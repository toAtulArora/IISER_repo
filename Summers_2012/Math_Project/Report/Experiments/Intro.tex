\section{Introduction}
My summer project consisted of two parts. The first was about reading Linear Algebra in greater depth than was covered in the course, and the second was about exploring Knot theory. For the former, I used the second edition of Michael Artin's Linear Algebra, and for the latter various books were referred to. The most interesting part of the project was the very beauty of mathematical abstraction. It was exceedingly fascinating for me to follow the author's flow and to apply abstractions at various levels to achieve unusual, striking results. Apart from the mainstream mathematics, during the exploration period, I read a little about mathematical history, the development of sigma delta definitions, quarternions and spent significant time on understand mathematical developments on the understanding of Knots. Overall, it was a very enriching experience, the mathematical part of which has been documented in detail using LaTeX, learning which, for typecasting the report, turned out to be another very rewarding skill.
