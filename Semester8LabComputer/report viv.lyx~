\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

s different and inductance is equal to 
\emph on
L
\emph default
.
 We can then use 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}=Ue^{i(knQ-wt)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}'=Ve^{i(knQ-wt)}.$
\end_inset

 One obtains two equations with constant coefficients in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V,$
\end_inset

 so the determinant of the coefficients should be zero for a non-trivial
 solution, which yields the following relation.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(w^{2}-\frac{1}{LC_{1}}-\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{LC_{2}}+\frac{e^{-ikQ}}{LC_{1}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{LC_{2}}+\frac{e^{ikQ}}{LC_{1}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which implies, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w(k)=\frac{1}{LC_{1}}+\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\pm\sqrt{\left[\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\right]^{2}+\left[\frac{1}{LC_{1}}\right]^{2}+\frac{2}{L^{2}C_{1}C_{2}}coskQ}
\]

\begin_layout Standard
This gives rise to two solutions, depending upon the sign of the term in
 the square root.
 The positive root corresponds to the optical band of the dispersion relation
 while the negative band corresponds to the acoustic band.
 The band gap can be calculated by finding the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for which the difference between the two solutions is minimum.
 Clearly, such a solution exists for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=(2m+1)\pi,\ m\in\mathbb{N}.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In this experiment, the index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 would vary from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $5.$
\end_inset

 So, like in the previous case, the phase difference between the input and
 outout current is 
\begin_inset Formula $4kQ.$
\end_inset

Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental setup is shown in the figure 1.
 For both types of lattices, one notes the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for which the total phase difference between the input(X) and output current(Y)
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m\frac{\pi}{2},\ m\in\mathbb{N}.$
\end_inset

 For the odd multiples, one obtains elliptical figures on the 
\emph on
X-Y 
\emph default
mode of oscilloscope(the amplitude of the signal need not remain the same)
 which can be transformed into circles by modifying the knob 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}.$
\end_inset

 Ideally speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}$
\end_inset

 should control the ratio of amplitudes of the input and output signals
 without modifying the 
\begin_inset Formula $w.$
\end_inset

 But that doesn't happen in this setup, consequently the knob should be
 kept constant throughout the experiment, especially during the diatomic
 case.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a resistor between 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the first 
\begin_inset Formula $L.$
\end_inset

Comments

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't understand the physical reason behind the spring mass system
 with different masses and same spring constants and that with different
 springs constants and identical masses giving rise to the same dispersion
 relation.
 Moreover, if we transform the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}\rightarrow C_{i}$
\end_inset

 and vice versa, we do get the same equations.
 However, we could not think of the spring-mass analogue of the system where
 the positions of the capacitor and inductor has been interchanged.
 Furthermore, why are we able to predict the behavior of a chain of finite
 no.
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $LC$
\end_inset

 elements using the analysis of an infinite chain of these elements? A rigorous
 explanation of why the phase difference between the output and input current
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-1)kQ$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $NkQ$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of

 elements in the curc
