\begin_layout Title
Lattice Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explore the dynamics of a 1D spring mass lattice, using an equivalent
 electronic/electrical circuit.
 We consider two configurations which correspond to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an array of point masses (identical) connected by springs of equal spring
 constant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an array of point masses (identical) connected by springs with alternate
 springs having the same spring constant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We show rigorously which quantities correspond to which in both setups.
 We then evaluate the dispersion relation, viz the relation between the
 frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and (TODO: Name of k) 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 theoretically and plot it.
 In the same graph, we plot the applied frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and measured value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are certain curious theoretical questions which the experiment has
 raised, some of which we have addressed and the remaining have been stated,
 in the last section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Background Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spring Mass System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following spring mass system.
 We write the forces on the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

 oscillator as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\ddot{x}_{n}=-\gamma(x_{n}-x_{n-1})+\gamma(x_{n+1}-x_{n})
\]

\end_inset

and we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}=Ae^{i(kna-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

 can be used to find the dispersion relation, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 We skip the detailed derivation here and come back to it in the LC circuit
 equivalent of the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, consider next the spring mass system as given below.
 We again write two sets of equations for the forces on both types of 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

 oscillator as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{1}\ddot{x}_{n}=-\gamma_{2}(x_{n}-x_{n}')+\gamma_{1}(x_{n-1}'-x_{n})
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{2}\ddot{x}_{n}'=-\gamma_{1}(x_{n}'-x_{n+1})+\gamma_{2}(x_{n}-x_{n}')
\]

\end_inset

where we take 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}=m_{2}=m$
\end_inset

 which can be solved by using 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}=Ue^{i(kna-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}'=Ve^{i(kna-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

.
 Again the detailed solution is discussed in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
L, C circuit equivalent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following LC circuit.
 We can write down using Kirchoff's law the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-L\ddot{q}_{n}-C^{-1}(q_{n}-q_{n-1})+C^{-1}(q_{n+1}-q_{n})=0
\]

\end_inset

The equivalence then is that 
\begin_inset Formula $L\leftrightarrow m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/C\leftrightarrow\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leftrightarrow q$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that we may differentiate the equation again with
 respect to time to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leftrightarrow\dot{q}=i$
\end_inset

.
 Further, observe that we could've easily used 
\begin_inset Formula $C\leftrightarrow m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/L\leftrightarrow\gamma$
\end_inset

 in this case, but this will not work in general for obvious reasons.
 note however that we'll consider this equivalence only when we deal with
 observables in the laboratory.
 In the rest of the analysis, we use the former.
 Again, we may use 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}=Ae^{i(kna-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 & \dot{q}=-i\omega q\\
 & \ddot{q}=\omega^{2}q\\
\implies & L\omega^{2} & = & C^{-1}e^{ikna}+C^{-1}e^{-ikna}-2C^{-1}\\
\implies & \omega & = & \sqrt{\frac{2}{LC}(1-\text{cos}(ka)}
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

Note here that 
\begin_inset Formula $kna$
\end_inset

 is reminiscent of the solution we used in the spring mass system where
 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 had some significance (interatomic distance), however now there's none.
 Further, we only use the product 
\begin_inset Formula $ka$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now in the usual case, we impose a periodic boundary condition, which (claim)
 results in giving 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 distinct solutions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 by quantizing 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2\pi m}{Na}$
\end_inset

(where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of entities).
 [todo: proof] This is also expected since for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 oscillators, there should be 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 normal modes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in the given experimental setup, viz.
 our case, we do not have a periodic boundary.
 Infact, the differential equations don't fully capture the physical system
 because the end points of the 1D chain, don't satisfy the equations.
 To overcome the issue, we imagine the chain to be infinite in length and
 consider only a part of it.
 We therefore hypothesize that we are giving an input charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}(t)=Ae^{-i\omega t}$
\end_inset

 on the zeroth capacitor (just a label) and read the charge at the last
 capacitor (due to the inductor on the left), viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{N-1}=Ae^{-i(ka(N-1)-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

 (although experimentally we're measuring current which is equivalent as
 was explained earlier).
 Since we're taking the real part of these quantities, we find that if we
 plot 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

-axis and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{N-1}$
\end_inset

 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

-axis using the 
\begin_inset Formula $XY$
\end_inset

 mode on the oscillator, we get a graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{cos}(\omega t)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{cos}(\omega t-\phi)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=ka(N-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Obviously, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0$
\end_inset

, we'll get a straight line and for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\pi/2$
\end_inset

 we'll get a circle.
 This information can be used to find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $ka$
\end_inset

 for various values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, which is to say we find only those 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

s for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $m\pi/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that there's an upper limit to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=2/\sqrt{LC}$
\end_inset

 because, well, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{cos}(ka)$
\end_inset

 is bounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next consider the following LC circuit.
 We can write down using Kirchoff's law the following: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-L_{1}\ddot{q}_{n}-C_{2}^{-1}(q_{n}-q_{n}')+C_{1}^{-1}(q_{n-1}'-q_{n})=0
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-L_{2}\ddot{q}_{n}'-C_{1}^{-1}(q_{n}'-q_{n+1})+C_{2}^{-1}(q_{n}-q_{n}')=0
\]

\end_inset

(claim) It is an interesting fact that regardless of which of the following
 cases we take
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}=L_{2}=L$
\end_inset

 and capacitors different 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1}=C_{2}=C$
\end_inset

 and inductors different
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is identical, given we interchange in one of the expressions, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

s with 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider the physical case, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

s different, and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}=L_{2}=L$
\end_inset

, and use 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}=Ue^{i(kna-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}'=Ve^{i(kna-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

 we obtain by equating the determinant of the algebraic equations to zero,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\omega^{2}-\frac{1}{LC_{1}}-\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{LC_{2}}+\frac{e^{-ika}}{LC_{1}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{LC_{2}}+\frac{e^{ika}}{LC_{1}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which finally yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega^{2}=\frac{1}{LC_{1}}+\frac{1}{LC_{2}}
\]

\end_inset
