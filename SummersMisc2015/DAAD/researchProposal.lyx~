\begin_layout Title
Quantum information with modular variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Atul Singh Arora
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am interested in exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics.
 This I find especially interesting because the very postulates of the theory
 lead to some striking classically unexpected results which have been verified
 experimentally, themselves aren't fully consistent; the measurement postulate
 and the unitary time-evolution.
 Action at a distance like effects, which arise form quantum correlations
 slash entanglement therefore are at the heart of the theory.
 These effects when carefully studied lead to predictions that act as tests
 for a system in states that can't be described classically [arXiv:0811.2803].

\begin_layout Standard
Experimentally these tests have been performed on photonic and atomic systems.
 However, performing these tests on massive systems is still an area of
 research.
 A proposed scheme for such tests is the use of modular variables (which
 I'll describe shortly) of macroscopic continuous variable systems [Phys.
 Rev.
 Lett.
 112, 190402 (2014)].
 The objective of the project would be to use modular variables to understand
 the origin of quantum effects, viz.
 effects peculiar slash characteristic to quantum mechanical objects.
 These tests may even be used to quantify entanglement in such systems and
 prove to be an interesting route to studying the foundations of the subject.

\begin_layout Standard
Modular variables in simple terms may be understood as variables that are
 bounded, which makes them `nice'.
 In continuous systems, variables like position and momentum (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

) are unbounded.
 Use of modular variables such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos(p)$
\end_inset

, which in fact can be measured, maybe used in the aforesaid context instead.
