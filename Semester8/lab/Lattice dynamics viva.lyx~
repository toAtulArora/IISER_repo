Aim of the experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this experiment is to study the dispersion relations in the mono-atom
ic and diatomic lattices and measure the cutoff frequency in the former
 and the band gap (between the acoustic and optical modes) in the latter.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a chain of inductors (of inductance) 
\emph on
L.
 
\emph default
Imagine a wire parallel to this chain, connected to the chain after each
 inductor through a capacitor with a capacitance 
\emph on
C.
 
\emph default
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 be the current through the 
\emph on
n-
\emph default
th inductor.
 The equation governing the dynamics of such a system can be written using
 the Kirchoff's voltage rule.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-L\frac{dI_{n}}{dt}-\frac{q_{n}-q_{n+1}}{C}+\frac{q_{n-1}-q_{n}}{C}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the charge on the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
-th capacitor due to current 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}.$
\end_inset

 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{2}q_{n}}{dt^{2}}=\frac{dI_{n}}{dt}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The dynamics are similar to a spring mass system of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 point masses (of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

) connected to each other with springs of force constants 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{C}.$
\end_inset

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}$
\end_inset

 is then analogous to the displacement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th particle.
 Such a system of ODEs can be solved by putting the following guess solution.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{n}=Ae^{i(knQ-wt)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Which yields,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Lw^{2}Ae^{i(knQ-wt)}=\frac{1}{C}Ae^{i(knQ-wt)}e^{ikQ}+\frac{1}{C}Ae^{i(knQ-wt)}e^{-ikQ}-2\frac{1}{C}Ae^{i(knQ-wt)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Solving the above equation gives, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w(k)=\sqrt{\frac{2(1-\text{cos}kQ)}{LC}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The frequency can now be obtained by the following relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nu=\frac{2\pi}{w}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this experiment, we have a series of 10 
\emph on
LC 
\emph default
components.
 One supplies an alternating current and a single 
\emph on
LC 
\emph default
component introduces a phase lag.
 Naively thinking (as we did!), we can put the input current as 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and every time the current crosses the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
th 
\emph on
LC 
\emph default
component, it picks up a phase lag of 
\begin_inset Formula $kQ.$
\end_inset

 So, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}=I_{1}e^{i(-wt+kQ)}$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 Finally, we measure 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{10}$
\end_inset

 and find how much phase lag has been introduced in total.
 Clearly, we expect a phase difference of 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)kQ.$
\end_inset

 This would give us the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $kQ.$
\end_inset

 One might ask, how are we representing a system of infinite no.
 of 
\emph on
LC 
\emph default
components by a system of 10 components.
 And, that's a good question, but I don't know the answer! Anyhow, we increase
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,$
\end_inset

 so that we can make the phase difference equal to an integral multiple
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{2}.$
\end_inset

 We then plot 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{10}$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1},$
\end_inset

 and obtain an ellipse (assume the amplitude won't remain same) for the
 odd multiples and straight lines (with slopes 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

).
 At a certain stage, (see equation 5), 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cos}kQ$
\end_inset

 would become equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.$
\end_inset

 Consequently, there's an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $w,$
\end_inset

 which one can call the cutoff frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Diatomic Lattice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens if the adjacent atoms in a spring-mass system are not identical?
 We can analyze the spring mass system where the adjacent masses are different
 but the spring constants are identical.
 Our analogical LC circuit would then consist of different inductors (with
 inductance 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

) and identical capacitors (
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $)$
\end_inset

.
 In turns out, in our experimental circuit we have the same inductor 
\begin_inset Formula $(L_{0})$
\end_inset

 throughout the chain, but different capacitors 
\begin_inset Formula $(C_{1},\ C_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Surprisingly, the resulting dispersion relation is the same, if one makes
 the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}\rightarrow C_{i}.$
\end_inset

 Thus, we proceed with the analysis for the case when the spring constants
 are different.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting equations are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-L\frac{dI_{n}}{dt}-\frac{q_{n}-q_{n}^{'}}{C_{2}}+\frac{q_{n-1}^{'}-q_{n}}{C_{1}}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-L\frac{dI_{n}^{'}}{dt}-\frac{q_{n}^{'}-q_{n+1}}{C_{1}}+\frac{q_{n}-q_{n}^{'}}{C_{2}}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

s different and inductance is equal to 
\emph on
L
\emph default
.
 We can then use 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}=Ue^{i(knQ-wt)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}'=Ve^{i(knQ-wt)}.$
\end_inset

 One obtains two equations with constant coefficients in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V,$
\end_inset

 so the determinant of the coefficients should be zero for a non-trivial
 solution, which yields the following relation.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(w^{2}-\frac{1}{LC_{1}}-\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{LC_{2}}+\frac{e^{-ikQ}}{LC_{1}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{LC_{2}}+\frac{e^{ikQ}}{LC_{1}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which implies, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w(k)=\frac{1}{LC_{1}}+\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\pm\sqrt{\left[\frac{1}{LC_{2}}\right]^{2}+\left[\frac{1}{LC_{1}}\right]^{2}+\frac{2}{L^{2}C_{1}C_{2}}coskQ}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives rise to two solutions, depending upon the sign of the term in
 the square root.
 The positive root corresponds to the optical band of the dispersion relation
 while the negative band corresponds to the acoustic band.
 The band gap can be calculated by finding the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for which the difference between the two solutions is minimum.
 Clearly, such a solution exists for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=(2m+1)\pi,\ m\in\mathbb{N}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this experiment, the index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 would vary from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $5.$
\end_inset

 So, like in the previous case, the phase difference between the input and
 outout current is 
\begin_inset Formula $4kQ.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental setup is shown in the figure 1.
 For both types of lattices, one notes the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for which the total phase difference between the input(X) and output current(Y)
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m\frac{\pi}{2},\ m\in\mathbb{N}.$
\end_inset

 For the odd multiples, one obtains elliptical figures on the 
\emph on
X-Y 
\emph default
mode of oscilloscope(the amplitude of the signal need not remain the same)
 which can be transformed into circles by modifying the knob 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}.$
\end_inset

 Ideally speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}$
\end_inset

 should control the ratio of amplitudes of the input and output signals
 without modifying the 
\begin_inset Formula $w.$
\end_inset

 But that doesn't happen in this setup, consequently the knob should be
 kept constant throughout the experiment, especially during the diatomic
 case.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a resistor between 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the first 
\begin_inset Formula $L.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Comments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't understand the physical reason behind the spring mass system
 with different masses and same spring constants and that with different
 springs constants and identical masses giving rise to the same dispersion
 relation.
 Moreover, if we transform the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}\rightarrow C_{i}$
\end_inset

 and vice versa, we do get the same equations.
 However, we could not think of the spring-mass analogue of the system where
 the positions of the capacitor and inductor has been interchanged.
 Furthermore, why are we able to predict the behavior of a chain of finite
 no.
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $LC$
\end_inset

 elements using the analysis of an infinite chain of these elements? A rigorous
 explanation of why the phase difference between the output and input current
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-1)kQ$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $NkQ$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $LC$
\end_inset

 elements in the circuit is also missing.
