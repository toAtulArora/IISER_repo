\begin_layout Title
Angle of Repose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Atul Singh Arora
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2015
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Angle of repose is defined in the following situation.
 Consider physical entities which are small in size and large in number,
 such that when dropped from a given location, form a heap.
 The conical heap so formed can be characterized by the angle the inclined
 face of the cone makes with the horizontal.
 This angle is defined to be the angle of repose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The angle of repose experimentally, is known to lie primarily between 
\begin_inset Formula $30^{o}<\theta<45^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This angle is also known to depend experimentally on 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Coefficient of friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Shape of the grain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Size of the grain TODO: Complete this list
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next describe two cases in which one can make simplifying assumptions
 and arrive at the 
\begin_inset Formula $30^{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{o}$
\end_inset

 repose angle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hard Spheres
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the particles are spherical and density of mass within the sphere is uniform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
typically, the edge layer is formed as shown in the diagram
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can see clearly from the diagram that if the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>0$
\end_inset

, the centre of mass of the sphere is on the left of the farthest contact
 point, thus the object at this angle will fall off the pile.
 Plugging this condition yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta>30^{o}$
\end_inset

 will result in a slip.
 Thus we predict that the particles will keep contributing to the angle
 of repose until it hits 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim30^{o}$
\end_inset

 after which the newly added particles will fall off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Box sliding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the edge layer can be approximated effectively by an almost flat sheet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the particles can be approximated by box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this situation, the assumptions allow us to find the angle of repose
 as the condition for a box to just start sliding down an incline, which
 is well known to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\tan\theta=\mu$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient of friction.
 Since typically is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<1$
\end_inset

, we have typically 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta<45^{o}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following were used to perform the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rai (small spherical objects (
\begin_inset Formula $1.4<\text{diameter (mm)}<2.0$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Funnel (for dropping rai uniformly)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Microscope (for measuring the height of the heap)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discs (of various sizes to make the heap of various radius)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure followed was almost obvious.
 The particles were dropped using the funnel on the discs and the height
 of the resulting heap was measured.
 Ofcourse, it is easier said than done, but there's nothing illuminating
 in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We took one material and repeated the experiment 3 times for each disc,
 and used 5 different discs.

Result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was found that for a given material, the angle of repose was independent
 of the radius of the heap.
 Explicitly, change in repose angle which was expected at 
\begin_inset Formula $r/R\sim0.02$
\end_inset

 was 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 observed, where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the particle and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 that of the heap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Critique
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment didn't have a well established theory backing it therefore
 it was hard to find exactly what it is that one must verify.
