\begin_layout Standard
The theory for this experiment has been primarily been adapted from

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a typical wire.
 Stretching this leads to a small increase in length of the wire.
 At the microscopic level, the average distance between the atoms, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, increases.
 The attractive force between the atoms balances slash resists the applied
 tensile force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, shortening a metal by applying a compressive force leads to decrease
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and is again balanced by inter-atomic repulsion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these one can deduce that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When 
\begin_inset Formula $r>r_{eq}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{eq}$
\end_inset

 is the interatomic distance when the wire is not under stress (will be
 defined precisely later), the interatomic attraction is greater than repulsion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When 
\begin_inset Formula $r<r_{eq}$
\end_inset

, the interatomic repulsion is greater than interatomic attraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, from experience, we know that metals are harder to compress which
 suggests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Repulsive forces grow much more rapidly with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|r-r_{eq}\right|$
\end_inset

 compared to the attractive force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And finally, we also know that once a metal is stretched beyond a limit,
 it breaks and won't 'spring back together'.
 So we conclude
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the interatomic distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r>r_{max}$
\end_inset

 (some 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{max}$
\end_inset

) then the attractive forces become effectively zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these principels, we can plot the repulsive and attractive forces
 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 We can also plot energy against 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
We use the convention that repulsive forces are positive and attractive
 are negative.
 Combining these graphs results in the following.
 One must note that what we measure eventually is the combined effect of
 the attractive and repulsive components.
 In this sense the division between them is artificial.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the Hook's law (yet to be stated explicitly) is valid in the linear
 range of the force (and equivalently, the quadratic range of the potential).
 This explains the microscopic origin of Hook's law, which can be expressed
 in this context as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F\propto-(r-r_{eq})
\]

\end_inset

Using this relation, one can write a more relavent quantity, the Young's
 Modulus (which is defined such that it is fixed for a given material) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y=\frac{F/A}{\Delta l/l}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the tensile force (for the wire say, that we considered to start with),
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the surface area normal to the force, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l$
\end_inset

 is the change in length from the unstressed length (viz.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $F=0$
\end_inset

), and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is the length when 
\begin_inset Formula $F=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The setup allows one to essentially stretch a wire with known weight, as
 is required.
 Non-trivial aspects include a pulley (whose presence is not included in
 the calculations) and a radial dial (1 division = 0.25 cm) that measures
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l$
\end_inset

 with precision.

Result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Young's modulus for Constantan was found to be 
\begin_inset Formula $(9.500\pm0.178)\times10^{10}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $N/m^{2}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim2\%$
\end_inset

 precision) and for Copper it was 
\begin_inset Formula $(8.330\pm0.104)10^{10}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $N/m^{2}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1\%$
\end_inset

 precision).
 The breaking point of Constantan was found to occur just beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $(1.295\pm.0609)\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $N/m^{2}$
\end_inset

 while that of Copper was 
\begin_inset Formula $(1.219\pm.0609)\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $N/m^{2}$
\end_inset

where the error is caused by the smallest weight available (
\begin_inset Formula $50$
\end_inset

 g).

Critique
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The setup was not too shabby.
 The following improvements will reduce performance time and increase accuracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Get thinner small weights (they can be wide)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use a telescope to note 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l$
\end_inset

 instead of the angular measurement apparatus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The angular dial has the following issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the height of the dial has to be adjusted by trial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the range of the dial is restricted
