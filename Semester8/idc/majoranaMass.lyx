\begin_layout Title
Dirac and Majorana Mass

\begin_layout Abstract
The concept of mass is intuitively linked with inertia.
 It is first encountered in a quantitatively precise formulation, in the
 work of Newton.
 With Einstein's special relativity, it acquires a new meaning (
\begin_inset Formula $p^{2}=m^{2}$
\end_inset

) (and ofcourse again, with identification of gravitational mass and inertial
 mass; general relativity).
 In particle physics (the study of `fundamental' particles) historically,
 it has been hard and consequently interesting to formulate a consistent
 theory of particles interacting in the way we know they do from experiments,
 and implement their masses, taking inspiration from one of the most successful
 theory of physics, Quantum Electrodynamics (quantum generalization of classical
 electrodynamics).
 Assuming the knowledge of STR and QM, I'll motivate the concept of fields
 and particles and briefly describe how it all fits to describe fundamental
 particles.
 Thereafter, I'll take the example of a Klein Gordan Field (obtained by
 replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $i\hbar\vec{\nabla}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{2}=m^{2}$
\end_inset

) to explain the origin and definition of mass.
 Then I'll move to the main topic, that of Dirac and Majorana Mass, starting
 with the Dirac Equation.
 I'll describe the physical significance of this investigation, viz.
 why it is a candidate in describing the mass of neutrinos (a particle which
 was suspected to exist, assuming conservation of energy holds, by observing
 the spectrum of beta decay) and hint on alternatives.

Towards a quantum theory of fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can ask for a theory that links QM and STR, solely on grounds that QM
 is built on top of classical mechanics which we know is bound to fail when
 we goto higher speeds (thus energies).
 Practically though that's not such a big issue.
 However, when one looks at collision of particles, but can't make any predictio
ns about the products, except being able to veto products on whose mass
 is greater than the centre of mass energy (solely on the energy momentum
 relation based on STR), there's a real crisis.
 The idea is to build a theory that can automatically handle the creation
 and destruction of particles in a way that's fully consistent with STR
 and at the same time, predict the results of colliding high energy particles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Known Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may guess that instead of writing 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\text{classical}}\psi=-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi$
\end_inset

, if we write the relativistic version as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(E^{2}-\vec{p}^{2}\right)\psi=m^{2}\psi$
\end_inset

 and replace 
\begin_inset Formula $E\to-i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $i\vec{\nabla}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxempty\psi=m^{2}\psi
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxempty=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}^{2}-\vec{\nabla}^{2}$
\end_inset

, it might just solve the problem.
 As it turns out, this attempt fails miserably, leading to issues in causality
 (events in the past are affected by the future), negative energies (this
 means there's no energy minima, which implies there's no stable ground
 state) among others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can actually predict that things will get inconsistent simply by observing
 that in QM, time and position are treated very differently; one is a parameter,
 the other's an operator.
 STR seamlessly mixes the two.
 This meant that we need to either make time an operator (which again is
 known to not work) or demote position from an operator to a parameter.
 All these hint to interpreting the object 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Concept of field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This idea almost sounds like it's been taken from a fairy tale, even though
 we're familiar with a similar notion.
 It is that of a field.
 Fields were first encountered in the context of electromagnetism.
 In the beginning, we use it as a device for calculating forces, and once
 we reach the Maxwell equations, we find that these fields can exist without
 sources that we thought they were an artifact of, to start with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, there's a field for every fundamental

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I know I haven't defined the word `fundamental' yet, but its intent and
 meaning will become obvious as we proceed.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 particle.
 This field can create particles out of thin air and destroy them too.
 These fields can talk to each other and consequently the particles can
 interact.
 If we can construct a framework in which if we write a relativistically
 covariant (or invariant?) Lagrangian describing the fields and their interactio
n, it produces for us probabilities of all possible processes that involve
 these particles, then, then that does it in principle.
 It'll only remain to write the right Lagrangian (which has taken years
 to pin down exactly and is known as the Standard Model
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Except ofcourse neutrino masses and oscillations
\end_layout

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Framework: QFT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us start with a classical field.
 Consider the simplest case, a real scalar field.
 Imagine a number being assigned to every location in space and time.
 If I demand that the field must satisfy the Klien Gordan equation
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
where note now that 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is only a parameter to start with
\end_layout

\end_inset

, I can write a Lagrangian
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
density to be precise
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial^{\mu}\phi\partial_{\mu}\phi+m^{2}\phi\right)
\]

\end_inset

by noting that the equation of motion produced by this 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is the Klien Gordan equation itself.
 Note that in general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi(t,\vec{x})$
\end_inset

.
 If I further assume that it is sufficiently well behaved, I can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi=\int\frac{d^{3}p}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}\sqrt{2\omega_{p}}}\,\left(ae^{i\mathbf{px}}+a^{\dagger}e^{-i\mathbf{px}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $a=a(\vec{p})$
\end_inset

 and the second term added explicitly to ensure 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is real
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d^{3}p}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}\sqrt{2\omega_{p}}}$
\end_inset

 is a Lorentz invariant measure which I won't discuss here
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 I can also evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, the conjugate momentum from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

.
 If I impose now, the commutation (equal time) 
\begin_inset Formula $[\phi(t,\mathbf{x}),\pi(t,\mathbf{x}')]=i\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$
\end_inset

, (note, we just converted our classical field to a quantum field) it can
 be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $[a(\mathbf{p}),a^{\dagger}(\mathbf{p}')]\sim\delta(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{p}')$
\end_inset

.
 Further, it can be shown that the Hamiltonian for the given Lagrangian,
 turns out to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\sim a^{\dagger}a+\frac{1}{2}[a(\mathbf{p}),a^{\dagger}(\mathbf{p})]
\]

\end_inset

This now has striking similarities to the quantum harmonic oscillator.
 This motivates existence of states such as 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\dagger}(\vec{p})\left|\text{vacuum}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 which can be rigerously shown to be particles indeed.
 From the space-time translation invariance, one can arrive
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
using Noether's theorem
\end_layout

\end_inset

, at the physical momentum and energy operators.
 If the aforesaid state indeed represents a particle, it must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{2}-\vec{p}^{2}=m^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 And infact, it so turns out that applying the momentum operator and the
 hamiltonian operator and finding the eigenvalues of this state produces
 exactly that.
 Thus we conclude that this state indeed represents a particle that has
 a definite energy and momentum.
 Further, we now know that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 that appeared in the Lagrangian was indeed the mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, the example we took had only one field which interacts with nothing.
 Any observable field must interact to be observable.
 QFT is developed then as a perturbation theory, expanded around the non-interac
ting part, such as the one just described.
 This results in what are known as Feynman rules.
 These rules can be used to evaluate quantities such as decay rates and
 scattering cross sections, which can be measured experimentally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the discussion of mass, it must be mentioned that when interactions are
 introduced, the term 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 in the Lagrangian, no longer represents mass.
 In that case, it is defined as the pole of the `full propogator'.
 I'll leave it at that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Dirac and Majorana Mass
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Dirac Equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider the famous Dirac equation and the particles its field
 produces.
 I must begin with motivating the Dirac equation, because it can be overwhelming
 at first.
 The idea was to factor the Klien Gordan equation.
 So I start with writing an equation of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(i\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}-m)\psi=0
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are to start with, some parameters (we think of them as numbers to start
 with).
 Now if I multiply this equation with itself (excluding the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 part), I'll have
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal

\bar no

\color none

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned} & (i\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}-m)(i\partial_{\nu}\gamma^{\nu}-m)\\
= & (-\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu}-im\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu})-(im\partial_{\nu}\gamma^{\nu}-m^{2})\\
= & (-\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}\{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}-2m\left[i(\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu})\right]+m^{2})\\
= & (-\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}\{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}-2m^{2}+m^{2})\\
= & (-\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}\{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}-m^{2})
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

Now if I want this to become Klien Gordan, it's trivial to conclude that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}=-2\delta^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Now without getting into more detail, I'll just claim that the parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 matrices and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 then is a 
\begin_inset Formula $4-$
\end_inset

component object, called a Dirac spinor.
 It is useful to work in a specific basis (choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

) which for this discussion I'll take out of a hat to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\sigma^{\mu}\equiv(1,\mathbf{\vec{\sigma})} &  & \overline{\sigma}^{\mu}\equiv(1,-\vec{\sigma})\\
\gamma^{\mu} & \equiv & \left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & \sigma^{\mu}\\
\overline{\sigma}^{\mu} & 0
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

One can check that the anti-commutation is indeed what we wanted.

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 has interesting transformation properties which I won't derive but state
 as and when I need them.
 I claim that if I write my four component 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L}\\
\psi_{R}

\]

\end_inset

then under a lorentz boost 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and a rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\theta}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\psi_{L}\rightarrow & e^{-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}-\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}}\psi_{L}=S_{L}\psi_{L}\\
\psi_{R}\rightarrow & e^{-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}+\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}}\psi_{R}=S_{R}\psi_{R}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

which in a compact form, I'll write as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi\rightarrow\Lambda_{1/2}\psi
\]

\end_inset

We need this to understand how must we write a Lagrangian for the Dirac
 equation.
 We must first realize that the Lagrangian is a scalar.
 We must understand therefore how to create scalars out of these objects
 we call Dirac spinors.
 A first guess at writing a real Lagrangian could be to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{\dagger}\psi$
\end_inset

.
 However, this object is not Lorentz invariant.
 This is easy to see by simply noting that the transformation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 is not unitary.
 I claim that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}\rightarrow\psi^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}\Lambda_{1/2}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

So now I simply define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\psi}\equiv\psi^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}
\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\psi}\rightarrow\overline{\psi}\Lambda_{1/2}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family roman
\series medium

Obviously now, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 is Lorentz invariant.
 I claim further that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi$
\end_inset

 transforms as a four-vector.
 Armed with these, I can write the following Lorentz invariant quantity
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Dirac}}=\overline{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-m)\psi
\]

\end_inset

I am allowed to call it the Dirac Lagrangian, if it's equation of motion
 is the Dirac equation itself.
 This is indeed so; recall 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_{\mu}\phi)}-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi}=0
\]

\end_inset

which in this case, (treating 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\psi}$
\end_inset

 as independent) for 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\psi}$
\end_inset

 yeilds the Dirac equation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since this discussion is focussed on the mass term, let me expand it for
 you.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\overline{\psi}\psi=m\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\psi_{L}^{\dagger} & \psi_{R}^{\dagger}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L}\\
\psi_{R}
\end{array}\right)=m(\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\psi_{L}+\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\psi_{R})
\]

\end_inset

The objective of this exercise was to show that in the Dirac equation, the
 mass term mixes the left and right spinors.
 We develop some more formalism and then see whether we can write a different
 Lorentz invariant mass term that doesn't mix the left and right parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Projectors, mixing of mass terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If from the full spinor, I wanted to obtain only the left handed part, I
 could do the following 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L}\\
\psi_{R}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L}\\
0
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

As it turns out, if I define 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{5}\equiv i\gamma^{0}\gamma^{1}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{3}$
\end_inset

, then in our basis it becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{5}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Note then that the left hand projector can be written simply as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{L}=\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}
\]

\end_inset

Similarly, its almost immediate that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{R}=\frac{1+\gamma^{5}}{2}
\]

\end_inset

Further, in our basis, it's obvious from explicit matrices corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{R}$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{L}+P_{R}=1_{4\times4}
\]

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{L}P_{R}=0;\,P_{R}P_{L}=0
\]

\end_inset

I claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\gamma^{5},\gamma^{\mu}\}=0$
\end_inset

 which allows me to show that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma^{\mu}P_{L}=\gamma^{\mu}\frac{\left(1-\gamma^{5}\right)}{2}=\frac{\left(1+\gamma^{5}\right)}{2}\gamma^{\mu}=P_{R}\gamma^{\mu}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally I define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Psi_{L}\equiv P_{L}\psi=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L}\\
0
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Psi_{R}\equiv P_{R}\psi=\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\
\psi_{R}
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

This allows me to write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi=1_{4\times4}\psi=\left(P_{L}+P_{R}\right)\psi=\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}
\]

\end_inset

along with the hermitian conjugate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{\dagger}=\psi^{\dagger}1_{4\times4}=\psi^{\dagger}\left(P_{L}+P_{R}\right)=\Psi_{L}^{\dagger}+\Psi_{R}^{\dagger}
\]

\end_inset

plus for clarity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\psi}=\psi^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}=\psi^{\dagger}1_{4\times4}\gamma^{0}=\psi^{\dagger}\left(P_{L}+P_{R}\right)\gamma^{0}=\Psi_{L}^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}+\Psi_{R}^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}=\overline{\Psi}_{L}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}
\]

\end_inset

and that in turn allows me to expand the mass term 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}m\overline{\psi}\psi=m\left(\overline{\Psi}_{L}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}\right)\left(\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}\right) & = & m\left(\overline{\Psi}_{L}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}\right)\left(\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}\right)\\
 & = & m\left(\overline{\Psi}_{L}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}\right)\left(\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}\right)\\
 & = & m\left(\overline{\Psi}_{L}\Psi_{R}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}\Psi_{L}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

It is easy to get confused between the equation we derived in the previous
 subsection 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\overline{\psi}\psi=m(\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\psi_{L}+\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\psi_{R})
\]

\end_inset

but both are correct and equivalent.
 The latter is written in the 2-component form, while the former is in the
 4-component notation.
 And while I'm still discussing notation, let me define for a four vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\cancel{B}\equiv\gamma^{\mu}B_{\mu}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in this notation, I can write the Lagrangian as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\mathcal{L}_{\text{Dirac}} & = & \overline{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-m)\psi\\
 & = & \left(\overline{\Psi}_{L}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}\right)\left(i\cancel{\partial}-m\right)\left(\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}\right)\\
 & = & \overline{\Psi}_{L}i\cancel{\partial}\Psi_{L}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}i\cancel{\partial}\Psi_{R}-m\left(\overline{\Psi}_{L}\Psi_{R}+\overline{\Psi}_{R}\Psi_{L}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

Note how the kinetic term has the left and right handed spinor separated,
 but the mass term is mixing the spinor components.
 We now have enough machinery to explore mass terms that don't mix the spinor
 components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Majorana Mass
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I start with defining the following matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=i\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma^{2} & 0\\
0 & -\sigma^{2}
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Now I go back to the transformations of the Dirac spinor.
 
\family roman
\series medium

\size normal
\emph off
\bar no

If I write 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{T}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{T}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\psi_{L}^{T} & \psi_{R}^{T}\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

then under a lorentz boost 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and a rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\theta}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\psi_{L}^{T}\rightarrow & \psi_{L}^{T}e^{-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma^{T}}}{2}-\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma^{T}}}{2}}=\psi_{L}^{T}S_{L}^{T}\\
\psi_{R}^{T}\rightarrow & \psi_{R}^{T}e^{-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}^{T}}{2}+\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}^{T}}{2}}=\psi_{R}^{T}S_{R}^{T}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

which in a compact form, according to prior definitions is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{T}\rightarrow\psi^{T}\Lambda_{1/2}^{T}
\]

\end_inset

Noting from the explicit Pauli matrices, 
\family default

\begin_inset Formula

\begin{aligned}\sigma^{1} & = & \left(\begin{array}{cc}

1 & 0
\end{array}\right)\\
\sigma^{2} & = & \left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -i\\

\end{array}\right)\\
\sigma^{3} & = & \left(\begin{array}{cc}

\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset


\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\strikeout off
\uuline off
\uwave off
\noun off
\color none
we see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{alignedat}{2}\left(\sigma^{1}\right)^{T} & = & \sigma^{1}\\
\left(\sigma^{2}\right)^{T} & = & -\sigma^{2}\\
\left(\sigma^{3}\right)^{T} & = & \sigma^{3}
\end{alignedat}
\]

\end_inset

Further, we can use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\sigma^{i},\sigma^{k}\}=2\delta^{ik}$
\end_inset

 to see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{alignedat}{2}\left(\sigma^{1}\right)^{T}\sigma^{2} & = & -\sigma^{2}\sigma^{1}\\
\left(\sigma^{2}\right)^{T}\sigma^{2} & = & -\sigma^{2}\sigma^{2}\\
\left(\sigma^{3}\right)^{T}\sigma^{2} & = & -\sigma^{2}\sigma^{3}
\end{alignedat}
\]

\end_inset

and this is fantastic, why? Well, consider the object 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We'll have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2}\rightarrow\psi_{L}^{T}e^{-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma^{T}}}{2}-\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma^{T}}}{2}}\sigma^{2}=\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2}e^{-\left(-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}-\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}\right)}=\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2}S_{L}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

and by the same reasoning, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{R}^{T}\sigma^{2}\rightarrow\psi_{R}^{T}e^{-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}^{T}}{2}+\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}^{T}}{2}}\sigma^{2}=\psi_{R}^{T}\sigma^{2}e^{-\left(-i\mathbf{\theta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}+\mathbf{\beta}.\frac{\mathbf{\sigma}}{2}\right)}=\psi_{R}^{T}\sigma^{2}S_{R}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

We now want to write this in the compact notation.
 For this, we note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{T}C=i\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\psi_{L}^{T} & \psi_{R}^{T}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma^{2} & 0\\
0 & -\sigma^{2}
\end{array}\right)=i\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2} & -\psi_{R}^{T}\sigma^{2}\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that the transformation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{T}C\rightarrow i\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\psi_{L}^{T}S_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2} & -\psi_{R}^{T}S_{R}^{T}\sigma^{2}\end{array}\right)=i\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2}S_{L}^{-1} & -\psi_{R}^{T}\sigma^{2}S_{R}^{-1}\end{array}\right)=\psi^{T}C\lambda_{1/2}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

And what will all of this do? Well, it means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi^{T}C\psi\rightarrow\psi^{T}C\lambda_{1/2}^{-1}\lambda_{1/2}\psi=\psi^{T}C\psi
\]

\end_inset

so that means we have arrived at a Lorentz scalar! Before proceeding, I'll
 make two comments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We could've arrived at the same result by simply noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1/2}^{T}C\lambda_{1/2}=C$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
I can write 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 as a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 matrices as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=i\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma^{2} & 0\\
0 & -\sigma^{2}
\end{array}\right)=-i\gamma^{2}\gamma^{0}
\]

\end_inset

which is easy to verify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So let us use this term finally to define a different mass term.
 I write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{alignedat}{2}\mathcal{L}_{\text{Majorana Mass}} & \sim & m\psi^{T}C\psi\\
 & = & -im\left(\Psi_{L}^{T}+\Psi_{R}^{T}\right)\gamma^{2}\gamma^{0}\left(\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}\right)\\
 & = & -im\left(\Psi_{L}^{T}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{0}\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}^{T}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{0}\Psi_{R}\right)\\
 & = & m\left(\Psi_{L}^{T}C\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{R}^{T}C\Psi_{R}\right)
\end{alignedat}
\]

\end_inset

so here I have arrived at a mass term which does 
\emph on
mix 
\emph default
the left and right spinors! I'd point out that this object ofcourse is not
 guaranteed to be real.
 To ensure that, we must add its hermitian conjugate (
\begin_inset Formula $-m\psi^{\dagger}C\psi^{*}$
\end_inset

).
 To conclude this subsection, I'd mention that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
there are what's called a majorana fermion, which is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 equals it's own `conjugate'.
 This results in reduction of degrees of freedom from 4 to 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is closely related to the charge conjugation operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and state some results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Lagrangian with the `kinetic part' is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{alignedat}{2}\mathcal{L}_{\text{Majorana}} & = & \psi_{L}^{\dagger}i\overline{\sigma}.\partial\psi_{L}+\frac{im}{2}\left(\psi_{L}^{T}\sigma^{2}\psi_{L}-\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\sigma^{2}\psi_{L}^{*}\right)\\
 & = & i\Psi_{L}^{\dagger}\cancel{\partial}\Psi_{L}-\frac{m}{2}\left(\Psi_{L}^{T}C\Psi_{L}+\Psi_{L}^{\dagger}C\Psi_{L}^{*}\right)
\end{alignedat}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Corresponding Euler Lagrange
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}i\overline{\sigma}.\partial\psi_{L}-im\sigma^{2}\psi_{L}^{*} & =0\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

which implies that the Klien Gordan is satisfied and since it is derived
 from a Lorentz invariant lagrangian, it too is Lorentz invariant.

In the physical world, we don't observe `right handed'

 neutrinos.
 Even the `left handed' neutrino was thought to be massless for a long period
 of time.
 The standard model consequently has been created to have the following
 term
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}=\overline{\nu}_{L}i\cancel{\partial}\nu_{L}
\]

\end_inset

However, lately experiments have shown that the `left handed' neutrinos
 also have mass.
 To implement them, we first of all need a way of handling the fact that
 there's just one part of the full spinor, viz.
 only 2 degrees of freedom.
 Plus the Dirac mass as we know it, necessarily mixes the left and right
 handed part.
 In this regard, atleast in some sense, the Majorana mass and Majorana spinor
 are possible candidates to describe neutrinos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For completeness, I must mention that there are other alternatives to describe
 the mass of neutrinos, such as the 'see-saw' model.
