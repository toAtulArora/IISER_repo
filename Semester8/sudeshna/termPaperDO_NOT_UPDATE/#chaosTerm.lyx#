\begin_layout Title
Lorenz Attractors

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lorenz attractor is the consequence of a set of 3 ordinary differential
 equations, which for a given range of parameters, results in chaotic solutions.
 This is of particular interest because the resultant solutions, when plotted
 in 3 dimensional space, move in a very contrained part of the space, intuitivel
y suggesting that its dimension must be between 1 and 3.
 What is further fascinating is that even though the solution is chaotic,
 it is possible to synchronize two lorenz attractors, which is to say that
 while the motion of neither can be modelled (chaotic), yet both perform
 the same chaotic motion.
 In this paper, I show numerically that the dimension of the `Lorenz attractor'
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim2$
\end_inset

 and demonstrate that it is indeed possible to synchronize two lorenz attractors.
 Further, a peculiar observation was made; the distance between the two
 solutions (a measure of synchrony), although appeared to drop exponentially
 initially, in accordance with the theory, there seemed to be a periodic
 increase and decrease which I haven't been able to account for theoretically.

\begin_layout Section
Lorenz Attractor, equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lorenz equations are given as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{x} & =\sigma(y-x)\\
\dot{y} & =rx-y-xz\\
\dot{z} & =xy-bz
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,r,b>0$
\end_inset

 are parameters.
 These were designed to model convection flows in the atmosphere.
 One can show various interesting properties of the attractor, including
 the fact that volumes in phase space contract under the flow, which results
 in elimination of existence of sources/repellers.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $r<1$
\end_inset

, it can be shown that the origin is globally stable.
 One can further show that, given 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{H}\equiv\frac{\sigma(\sigma+b+3)}{\sigma-b-1}
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1<r<r_{H}
\]

\end_inset

there exist two more stable fixed points, 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{-}$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $r>r_{H}$
\end_inset

 is where there's chaos, where chaos maybe defined as ``aperiodic long-term
 behaviour in a deterministic system that exhibits sensitive dependence
 on initial conditions''.

\begin_layout Section
Syncing two Lorenz attractors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon appropriate scaling (
\begin_inset Formula $u=x/10,v=y/10,w=z/20$
\end_inset

), I can define the same lorenz equations as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{u} & =\sigma(v-u)\\
\dot{v} & =ru-v-20uw\\
\dot{w} & =5uv-bw
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

I can couple another lorenz attractor as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{u}_{r} & =\sigma(v_{r}-u)\\
\dot{v}_{r} & =ru-v-20uw_{r}\\
\dot{w_{r}} & =5uv_{r}-bw_{r}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

where note that the coupling is done by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 The claim is that regardless of the initial conditions, both attractors
 synchronize nearly perfectly, exponentially fast.
 This is particularly interesting because even though we're feeding in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 variable, the other attractor is able to generate 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 to be in perfect sync.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantitatively, the claim is that if I define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{x} & =(u,v,w)\\
\mathbf{y} & =(u_{r},v_{r},w_{r})\\
\mathbf{d} & =\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $d\to0$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The proof is as follows.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{d}_{1} & =\sigma(d_{2}-d_{1})\\
\dot{d}_{2} & =-d_{2}-20ud_{3}\\
\dot{d}{}_{3} & =5ud_{2}-bd_{3}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

We now construct the following by multiplying the second equation with 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the third by 
\begin_inset Formula $4d_{3}$
\end_inset

 and then adding.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\]

\end_inset
