\section{Aim}
	To
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item observe circular fringes for a monochromatic light source (sodium lamp)
		\item obtain the wavelength of sodium D-lines
		\item obtain the separation of the sodium D-lines
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Apparatus}	
	Michelson interferometer setup, which consists of a sodium lamp source, diffusing glass, beam splitter, moveable and fixed mirror with measurement gauges, compensator

\section{Theory}
	\subsection{Introduction}
		Michelson interferometer is a rather simple and elegant experiment, where a beam is split into two and then made to meet after travelling different distances. 
	\subsection{Determining Wavelength}
		The easiest place to begin the analysis of this apparatus would be to ignore the thickness of the beam splitter and the compensator (which is anyway not needed for this experiment, as is explained later) and assume the observations are made at the centre of a far away screen (although in the experiment we've used a lens to focus at infinity). Now at this point, the path difference in the two beams of light would be essentially because of twice the distance between the fixed mirror and the image of the movable mirror. Let this be given by $2d$, where $d$ is the distance between the said mirrors. Now imagine a point other than than the centre at the screen. The angle this makes with the principal axis, let that be $\theta$. The distance light will travel for this point, which can cause phase difference will be $2d \cos{\theta}$. Keeping in mind the fact that there's an abrupt phase change of $\pi$ because of reflection at the beam splitter, we have for destructive interference
		\begin{equation}
			2d\cos{\theta}=m\lambda
		\end{equation}
		and similarly, for constructive interference we'll have
		\begin{equation}
			2d\cos{\theta}=(m+1/2)\lambda
		\end{equation}
		It is easy to put in a few numbers \footnote{refer to page 15.23 of Ajoy Ghatak, Optics, 4th Edition for details} and conclude that reducing the distance causes fringes to collapse to the centre (while the spacing between fringes increases). Say for a given configuration, the centre's dark;
		\begin{equation}
			2d=m\lambda
		\end{equation}
		and say for a distance $d_o$ the same is achieved, and $N$ fringes have collapsed to the centre in the process. Then we have
		\begin{equation}
			2(d+d_o)=(m-N)/\lambda
		\end{equation}
		Subtracting these, gives us a simple method of finding the `average' wavelength of the sodium source
		\begin{equation}
			\lambda=2d_o/N
		\end{equation}

	\subsection{Resolving the D-Lines}
		That was the basic theory behind the experiment. Using a little more naiive Math, we can even find the small difference in the Sodium D-lines. Here's how we go about it. First `$d$' is made 0. Then the mirror is moved away (or towards) through a distance $d$. In general, the fringe patterns will overlap in some fashion. Assume a $d$ is such that,
		\begin{equation}
			2d\cos{\theta}=m\lambda_1 \\
			2d\cos{\theta}=(m+1/2)\lambda_2
		\end{equation}
		For small $\theta$, we can easily obtain
		\begin{equation}
			2d/\lambda_1 - 2d/\lambda_2 = 1/2
		\end{equation}
		Observe here what has happened. The maxima of one pattern falls on the minima of the other and vice versa. This means that what we obtain is all bright! Consequently, the pattern disappears in this situation. Making this general, if
		\begin{equation}
			2d/\lambda_1 - 2d/\lambda_2 = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 ..
		\end{equation}
		then the fringe pattern will disappear and for 1, 2, 3 .. it will reappear. Now let us move another step further. ay for an experiment, I find the distance between occurrence of two blank patterns, we have
		\begin{equation}
			2d_1 (1/\lambda_1 - 1/\lambda_2) = 1/2
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			2d_2 (1/\lambda_1 - 1/\lambda_2) = 3/2
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			2\Delta d (\Delta \lambda / \lambda^2) = 1
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\Rightarrow \Delta \lambda = \lambda^2/2\Delta d
		\end{equation}

\section{Observations and Calculations}	
	TODO: SHould be simple enough, the formulae are a child's play

\section{Result}
	TODO: Complete this

\section{Remarks}
	This experiment doesn't quite require the compensator since the source is monochromatic.
