Every honest researcher I know admits he's just a professional amateur.
He's doing whatever he's doing for the first time. That makes him an amateur.
He has sense enough to know that he's going to have a lot of trouble,
so that makes him a professional.\\ \medskip

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I express my sincere gratitude to our instructors, \myProf and \myOtherProf, for not only describing the experiments and their science in depth, but also for teaching us the art of observing, that of performing experiments, so we can appreciate the intellect behind the procedures, rather than mindlessly following them.\\
 \\
I also thank Vivek Sagar (MS11017) for his contribution to this report as my lab-partner, who made the task of performing experiments immensely comfortable and productive at the same time.\\
