% \section{Extra-Curricular Activities}
% 	\cvline{Guitar}{Music has enthralled me since childhood. Guitar started out for me as an adventure and till date I continue to learn. I had developed fluency in playing off of the staff notation, in addition to being able to play the common open and barre chords. I am still a novice though.}
% 	\cvline{Programming}{This is one of my favourite activities and for me, it's more of a tool that enables me to harness the full strength of the computer, as in it's absence, I feel restricted. I have programmed in various languages, with various objectives, ranging from pure entertainment, like Games, to programming a robot's movements.}
% 	\cvline{Electronics}{I have always been fascinated by automation and was fortunate to be exposed to electronics at an early age. I have used 8051 series of microcontrollers using Basic as the language. I later learnt C and moved to the AVR series. I have experience with various components such as MOSFETs, TRIACs etc. which assist in operating other devices.}
% 	\cvline{Debating}{I am presently a member of the Debating Society and enjoy the thrill of Parliamentery Debating, which sharpens your real time thinking, provides clarity and at the end of the day, helps you make better notes!}
% 	\cvline{Phonetics}{We all know how words are never pronounced the way they're written, in English that is. Yet we're never taught how to read the script that tells us how to pronounce them! So once you learn the script, you realize everybody's fallible.}
% 	\cvline{Tabla and Taekwondo}{They're clubbed here since both these activities, I was formally trained in. I was a `Red One' belt and learnt Tabla for over 3 years. However neither of these, have I been able to pursue lately.}


% \section{About Me}
% 	\cvline{Research Interests}{I haven't studied enough to do research, but I am most interested in Physics. I am particularly fascinated by Quantum Mechanics, and the associated Quantum Computing area. Both, the inherent counter-intuitive behaviour of microscopic particles, and computing, are topics which are very close to my heart.}
% 	\cvline{In General}{
% 	I adore science. I have experienced numerous `tears of joy' moments while studying books by authors such as `Goldberg', `Artin' and `Griffiths'. I am unable to leave problems unsolved (which is almost a curse for writing examinations) which has helped me learn a lot over the years. I like working on projects and studying. I dislike examinations, or atleast the kind we've taken so far. I value team work.}
% 	\cvline{Beliefs}{I believe that nothing worth having, comes without sacrifice and that as long as I'm working intelligently and hard, I shouldn't be disappointed by failures.}
% 	\cvline{Patriotism}{I firmly believe that this nation can strive to excellence, regardless of how unlikely it seems, for it is these few people who believed, have in the past, changed the map of the world, to what we see it as today.}
