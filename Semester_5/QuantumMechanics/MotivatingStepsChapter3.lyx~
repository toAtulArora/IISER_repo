\begin_layout Title
Steps and Motivation

\begin_layout Abstract
I was told once by one of my mathematic professors, Kapil H.
 Paranjape, that understanding a proof is not about understanding how one
 step follows from the previous.
 I could intuitively understand the meaning, but couldn't quite feel it.
 It was in a philosophy class that it occured to me that there are times
 in Quantum Mechanics, when I can understand the steps, but I can't grasp
 the idea.
 This was made apparent by our Physics Optics Laboratory instructor, Dr.
 Mandip Singh, when he asked us about how we would get the classical harmonic
 oscillator's oscillations in a quantum harmonic oscillator.
 So here, I have charted out the motivation behind the large spread of steps,
 so that I can understand the subject, and not only the steps of the derivations.
 Perhaps this is what 
\emph on
they
\emph default
 mean by developing intuition.

\begin_layout Part
The Theory of Angular Momentum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rotations and Angular Momentum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we aim at finding what we really mean by angular momentum
 and what we don't want it to mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We first note that rotations 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are not commutative (recall all its group properties too).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We find the commutation relation till second order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But we can show that infinitesimal rotations (upto first order) are in fact
 commutative.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Then you make the first leap.
 You recall the relation between infinitesimal translation and the linear
 momentum.
 Thereby define angular momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}$
\end_inset

 to be the operator that generates infinitesimal rotation.
 (CAVEAT: it is not always the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $r\times p$
\end_inset

, but it follows to be so in classical mechanics)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is important to pause here and think about what we're doing.
 We just created an operator (actually three since 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

, but fix one of it in your head) that acts on some ket 
\begin_inset Formula $|\alpha\rangle$
\end_inset

 in a space which doesn't necessarily have dimension 3.
 It is the operators that are three, each corresponding to one of the physically
 observable dimensions of space.
 Very important to note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We now define the finite rotation operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D_{k}}$
\end_inset

 using the definition of exponential as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
So far awesome.
 Now we want some commutation relation between the 
\emph on
angular momentum
\emph default
.
 It seems reasonable to think that we can use the commutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
For this it is 
\emph on
postulated
\emph default
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 have the same group properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we use the commutation relation of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 to get a commutation relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}_{k}$
\end_inset

 which in turn gives a commutation relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}$
\end_inset

, called the fundamental commutation relation of angular momentum.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Spin 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 Systems and Finite Rotations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we look at two approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In one, we construct a rotated ket, but keep the operator the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the other, we construct a Heisenberg like operator (by sandwitching the
 rotation operator), but keep the ket the same.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In both cases we calculate the expectation value, and as expected (pun intended)
, it turns out to be the same
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Use the Baker-Hausdorff lemma for evaluating using the second method
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For clarity, for a spin half system, with rotation about the z-axis, I'll
 state the result
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle S_{y}\right\rangle \rightarrow\left\langle S_{y}\right\rangle cos\phi+\left\langle S_{x}\right\rangle sin\phi
\]

\end_inset

and as expected (both intuitively (which intuition?) and from the commutation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}_{z}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{z}$
\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle S_{z}\right\rangle \rightarrow\left\langle S_{z}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As it turns out, it is clear that the expectation value of the spin operator
 does behave like components of a 3D vector being transformed.
 And the second method shows that we haven't used any property of a spin
 half system to get the result; the result is true for all spin operators.
 So that's the intuition!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Here's an un-intuitive result.
 The state ket (note it is any arbitrary state) picks up a minus sign upon
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $360^{0}$
\end_inset

 rotation (
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\alpha}\rightarrow-\ket{\alpha}$
\end_inset

).
 Another 
\begin_inset Formula $360^{0}$
\end_inset

 rotation makes it plus again.
 However, as far as the expectation value is concerned, we don't see this!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Here's an amazing application.
 The energy associated with a magnetic dipole is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu.B$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is related to the spin, the hamiltonian for such a system (with 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 fixed) is a constant times 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{z}$
\end_inset

say.
 So then the time evolution operator becomes a rotation operator!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With this, we actually can see the change in sign of a ket.
 The idea is simple.
 Let a beam of particles split (so that the state is the same) and make
 them go through two paths, say A and B.
 In one of the paths, add a magnetic field.
 This will change the state of the ket.
 Now make both interfere and observe the interference as a function of the
 rotation caused (can be done either by changing the time or the magnetic
 field).
 You get a verifyable result!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The other two subsections in the text are almost like solved example.
 Although somethings to think about include why pauli matrices have a -1
 determinant and a zero trace (explicitly it is obvious, but so is the fact
 that it is hermitian; however hermiticity follows from the spin operators
 being observable)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SO(3), SU(2) and Euler Rotations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since these notes are for you; I expect some familiarity with groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Intuitively (you can look at the book for rigour) there are 3 independent
 variables for specifying a rotation in 3D space.
 The group of such transformations (length and parity preserving) is called
 SO(3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We've seen how unitary operators preserve the norm of kets (think of time
 evolution), viz the `length'.
 It follows from unitarianism (hehe) that for a general 2x2 unitary operator's
 matrix representation, you can have at most 3 independent variables (4
 if you include a scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\gamma}$
\end_inset

, but you can get rid of that by demanding the determinant to be unity [unimodul
arity]).
 Do you smell the relation yet?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Now the cool part; We can always relate a unimodular unitary operator to
 a rotation (we saw that explicitly)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Can we do the other way, associate a rotation to every unimodular unitary
 operator? Think.
 Think about the 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 rotation.
 We (hopefully) clearly can't.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Euler Rotations are well (you know them intuitively very well), skipped.
 Just look at how the rotation is transformed from the axis of the rigid
 body, to the rotations about fixed axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Density Operators and Pure vs Mixed Ensambles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has been skipped for now
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of Angular Momentum
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is not what it should've been, but it is important as an algorithm
 anyway.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do precisely that, find eigenvalues and eigenstates of the angular momentum
 operators (well indirectly anyway) for a general dimension of the ket space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We start with finding out commutation relations between 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 They commute.
 We label their simultaneous eigenket as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{a,b}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then define ladder operators called 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}=J_{x}\pm iJ_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 We also find commutation relations between 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 We observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}$
\end_inset

 commute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we find the effect of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{z}J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{a,b}$
\end_inset

.
 Here we find something interesting.
 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 acts on a ket to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $b+\hbar$
\end_inset

, leaving 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 unchanged! Observe the cleverness of the trick.
 Note the similarity with the harmonic oscillator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lets see if we can get some constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 It is now shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}-J_{z}^{2}$
\end_inset

 results in a hermitian operator by expressing it in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

! So now since its expectation values are real.
 From here itself we get 
\begin_inset Formula $a\ge b^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 * We not only show its hermitian, we show its expectation value is 
\begin_inset Formula $>0$
\end_inset

.
 Then we get that result.
 TODO: Reformulate this properly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's do better, let's find the maximum and minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 That said, one can find 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{max}}$
\end_inset

by getting 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{-}J_{+}$
\end_inset

 to act on a maxed out ket 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{a,b_{\text{max}}}$
\end_inset

 and expressing the expression in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 You should get 
\begin_inset Formula $a-b_{\text{max}}^{2}-b_{\text{max}}\hbar=0$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly you can get the minimum as plus 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar$
\end_inset

.
 So on comparison of the equations, we now have 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{max}}=-b_{\text{min}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's now make things convenient.
 Logically it now follows 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{max }}=b_{\text{min }}+n\hbar$
\end_inset

.
 So we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{max}}=\frac{n\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Wait here to note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (its an integer) that we've found, is more like a constant at this stage
 than an index as you may think.
 What does it depend on? We'll answer shortly, but before that we finally,
 for convenience, define 
\begin_inset Formula $j=b_{\text{max}}/\hbar$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
From the relation we found between 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\hbar^{2}j(j+1)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 obviously is either an integer or a half integer.
 So our 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is actually dependent on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, the eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This determines the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{z}$
\end_inset

, a result we've been blindly learning from class X!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Also for convenience, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $b=m\hbar$
\end_inset

.
 Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is a half integer, so will 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 be.
 Else they're both happy integers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bravo, you've done it.
 Here's the final piece
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J^{2}\ket{j,m}=j(j+1)\hbar^{2}\ket{j,m}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{z}\ket{j,m}=m\hbar\ket{j,m}
\]

\end_inset

NOTE: The only property of 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}$
\end_inset

 that we've used is that of its commutation relation.
 So the result is therefore a rather general one, true for all kinds of
 angular momenta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The matrix elements can be easily derived
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
For 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{z}$
\end_inset

, it is simple, just use the definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

, you harness the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{+}^{\dagger}J_{+}=J^{2}-J_{z}^{2}-\hbar J_{z}$
\end_inset

 and compare the normalizaiton co-efficient and done!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Next we look at the matrix representation of the rotation operator
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotations don't affect the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 value of a ket 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{j,m}$
\end_inset

 (follows from the commutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

).
 Infact this is why we can represent it on a matrix.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, we can form a 
\begin_inset Formula $(2j+1)\times(2j+1)$
\end_inset

 matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For a given 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, finite rotations form a group.
 Unit, Inverse and Closure, all exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can express the rotation in terms of Euler angles, by using the relation
 derived in terms of rotations in the fixed frame.
 It then takes a particularly simple form, except for the rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\frac{-iJ_{y}\beta}{\hbar}}$
\end_inset

, whose matrix form is defined equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{m'm}^{(j)}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Orbital Angular Momentum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DOUBT: When we're talking about orbital angular momentum, it is interesting
 to think about the space in which a state resides and the space of the
 orbital angular momentum operator vs that of the momentum opreator (or
 translation operator).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of defining angular momentum to be a generator of infinitesimal
 rotation, we can also (in cases where spin-angular momentum can be ignored)
 define it to be the same as orbital angular momentum, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L=x\times p}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Orbital Angular Momentum as Rotation Generator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start with deriving the commutation relation 
\begin_inset Formula $[L_{i},L_{j}]=i\epsilon_{ijk}L_{k}$
\end_inset

 from the definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We can then for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}$
\end_inset

 show that it does in fact generate infinitesimal rotation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we look at the position representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k},\, L_{\pm},\, L^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Operate the infinitesimal rotation (along the z-axis) operate on a state
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and then take its position representation
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
then convert it to the corresponding spherical polar coordinates 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
taylor expand and compare, like you did for momentum, you'll get the answer
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Using 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}$
\end_inset

's position representation, and the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\pm}$
\end_inset

, find its representation too
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using what we've derived, find 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{2}$
\end_inset

, which turns out to be the angular part of the spherical laplacian
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We look at the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{2}$
\end_inset

 again to see why we get resemblence to the spherical laplacian
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Use an operator identity, which is derived using the summation form for
 the cross and dot product
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L^{2}=x^{2}p^{2}-(x.p)^{2}+i\hbar x.p
\]

\end_inset

So proving this is task 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then we find the position representation of each of the terms (the only
 trick is to operate the position vectors on the bra when required).
 Start from the right and goto left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Plug all the representations and you'll recover the same representation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{2}$
\end_inset

, viz.
 the angular part of the Laplacian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extra intuition comes from noting that if we write the position representation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{2}/2m$
\end_inset

, we see it has two parts, radial and angular (an 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{2}$
\end_inset

 term).

Obviously this is going to be the most general approach and can therefore
 be a little overwhelming.
 But don't worry.
 You did read it at some point of time.
 You'll do it again, but much faster this time.
 So lets start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider two angular momentum operator vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J_{1}}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J_{2}}$
\end_inset

 that live in two different subspaces (look at the examples for a deeper
 insight).

\begin_layout Enumerate
They both satisfy their usual commutation relation amongst themselves 
\begin_inset Formula $[J_{1i},J_{1j}]=i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}J_{1k}$
\end_inset

 and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Their components commute with the components of the other, viz 
\begin_inset Formula $[J_{1i},J_{2k}]=0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we write down an infinitesimal operator that affects both subspace 1
 and subspace 2.
 From this we define a new `total angular momentum' as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J_{1}}+\mathbf{J_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J}$
\end_inset

 also satisfies the usual angular momentum commutation

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note the distinction between 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J_{k}}$

, where the first represents the component of the total angular momentum
 (
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\{1,2,3\})$
\end_inset

 while the other represents one of the two initial angular momentum operator
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(k\in\{1,2\})$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $[J_{i},J_{j}]=i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}J_{k}$
\end_inset

 Wait here for a moment to realize that this does make sense.
 The total angular momentum is generating an infitesimal translation for
 the whole system.

Our next task is to choose a suitable basis for this problem.
 At this end there are two options
