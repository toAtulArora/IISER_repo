\begin_layout Chapter
The Principle of Relativity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Four Vectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following are some of the things that I had to spend some time figuring.
 This should help save some time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The derivation of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{iklm}e_{pklm}$
\end_inset

 is essentially based on counting.
 Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $klm$
\end_inset

 are distinct, say 
\begin_inset Formula $123$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{iklm}e_{pklm}$
\end_inset

 is non zero only if both 
\begin_inset Formula $i=p=0$
\end_inset

.
 That explains the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 symbol.
 The six comes from 
\begin_inset Formula $3!$
\end_inset

, the number of ways of fixing 
\begin_inset Formula $klm$
\end_inset

, given fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

).
 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e^{iklm}e_{pklm}=-6\delta_{p}^{i}
\]

\end_inset

Since all the indexes have to be unique, similarly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{iklm}e_{prlm}\neq0$
\end_inset

 we'll have for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $lm$
\end_inset

, say 2 3, either 
\begin_inset Formula $i=0,k=1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,k=0$
\end_inset

.
 For each case then, we can either have 
\begin_inset Formula $i=p$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $i=r$
\end_inset

.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $i,k$
\end_inset

 in how many ways can I fix 
\begin_inset Formula $lm$
\end_inset

, well 
\begin_inset Formula $2!$
\end_inset

.
 So that explains the result 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e^{iklm}e_{pklm}=-2(\delta_{p}^{i}\delta_{r}^{k}-\delta_{r}^{i}\delta_{p}^{k})
\]

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The space components of the antisymmetric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{ik}$
\end_inset

, can be written compactly using an axial vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 An axial vector is a pseudo vector, dual to some antisymmetric tensor.
 Thus we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{\alpha}=\frac{1}{2}e_{\alpha\beta\gamma}C_{\beta\gamma}
\]

\end_inset

However the problem is to write the spatial part (
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\beta\gamma}$
\end_inset

) of the antisymmetric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{ik}$
\end_inset

, given the axial vector 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 So now we simply multiply both sides of the given transformation relation
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\lambda\beta\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\lambda\beta\gamma}e_{\alpha\beta\gamma}=2\delta_{\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 to obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{\lambda}e_{\lambda\beta\gamma}=C_{\beta\gamma}
\]

\end_inset

 where I've substituted 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\alpha}=a_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is just a dummy index, could be 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 also, no problemo).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next place where I got stuck, is the generalization of the two dimensional
 surface in four-space.
 You can think of it (i'll just say it, no math) as follows.
 Think of any two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\alpha},x'_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

in 3D space.
 Now consider the projection of the area enclosed by these vectors on the
 XY plane, with the unit vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}=\hat{x_{1}}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}=\hat{x_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 I can write the projection on any of the plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x_{\alpha}}\hat{x_{\beta}}$
\end_inset

 in general, by simply writing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\alpha\beta}\equiv x_{\alpha}x'_{\beta}-x_{\beta}x'_{\alpha}
\]

\end_inset

the cross product of their projected components on that plane.
 This is essentially a second rank tensor.
 I can find the dual of this tensor as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\alpha}=\frac{1}{2}e_{\alpha\beta\gamma}f_{\beta\gamma}
\]

\end_inset

which is simply the normal! Now extending this to 4D, we see the dual turns
 out to be a tensor itself!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f*^{ik}=\frac{1}{2}e^{iklm}f_{lm}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's some orthonogonality of sorts (ASK someone or READ more).
 Anyway, we can show that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f^{ik}f_{ik}^{*}=f^{ik}e_{iklm}f^{lm}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Question: What would be a similar result for the 3D case?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The principle of least action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Very little to be said for this.
 Just note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{a}^{b}ds$
\end_inset

 has maxima for a straight world line.
 Thus for there to exist a minima, we take a negative sign in 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 The main result of the section was
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=-mc^{2}\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Energy and Momentum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
check the derivation for change in momentum when the force is parallel:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
check how and why we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}=d\mathbf{p}/dt$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
remember how conservation of mass doesn't hold, but mass is still an invariant
 under lorentz transformations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Main results of this section:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{p}=\partial L/\partial\mathbf{v}=\frac{m\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^{2}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathscr{E}=\mathbf{p.v}-L=\frac{mc^{2}}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^{2}}}\approx mc^{2}+\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can relate the Energy with the momentum as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p^{2}+m^{2}c^{2}=\frac{m^{2}v^{2}}{1-(v/c)^{2}}+m^{2}c^{2}=\frac{m^{2}c^{2}}{1-(v/c)^{2}}=\frac{\mathscr{E}^{2}}{c^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and can then express energy as a function of momentum (the hamiltonian,
 which in the limiting case becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $mc^{2}+p^{2}/2m$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathscr{E}=c\sqrt{p^{2}+m^{2}c^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also ahve between energy and momentum the relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{p}=\frac{\mathscr{E}\mathbf{v}}{c^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Enumerate
Defined an anologous Force as 
\begin_inset Formula $dP^{i}/ds$
\end_inset

.
 The hint for the first component is that you can write Energy as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{E}=\mathbf{p.v}-L$
\end_inset

 [ASK: How does L not depend on time? Perhaps we could say that since the
 equation of motion is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\mathbf{v}}\right)=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\mathbf{r}}
\]

\end_inset

Since the Lagrangian has no explicit dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

, it implies, the momentum is constant.
 This implies the velocity is constant.
 Thus all terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 are constants (with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

).

Question: Rigid body's definition, does the body's dimension change in different
 frames?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xplanation for non existence of rigid bodies is not clear.
 The use of three frames is clear, however I couldn't understand where the
 rigidity of the body was really required to show, that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 that too in a moving frame changes.

\begin_layout Section*

 Four-potential of a field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Added the interaction with the field in the action.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\int\left(-mcds-\frac{e}{c}A_{i}dx^{i}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can break this into the lagrangian (just re-epxress 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}dx^{i}$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A},\phi,d\mathbf{r},dt$
\end_inset

 and you get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=-mc^{2}\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}+\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A.v}-e\phi
\]

\end_inset

The origin of this makes sense now! (remember you saw this first in sakurai?,
 the Hamiltonian perhaps)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}=\partial L/\partial\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 to find the generalized momentum (we still use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

 for epxressing the momentum of the free particle).

 The electromagnetic field tensor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equations of motion can be derived using either the Lagrandian Formalism,
 or using the variation of action direclty.
 The latter's been done here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write down the action in the 4d notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write 
\begin_inset Formula $ds=\sqrt{dx_{i}dx^{i}}$
\end_inset

 and apply 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 to all the terms, without holding 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 consant.
 Also substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $dx_{i}/ds=du_{i}$
\end_inset

 as you go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Integrate by parts the two terms that don't have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta A_{i}$
\end_inset

 term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the part in the interal then, re-express 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta A_{i}=\frac{\partial A_{i}}{\partial x_{k}}\delta x_{k}
\]

\end_inset

and similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $dA_{i}$
\end_inset

 is re-expressed as partials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now use the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{i}=u^{i}ds$
\end_inset

, and change indices suitably, so that you can take 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x^{i}ds$
\end_inset

 common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now equating this to zero as usual, for the usual reasons, we get, (finally)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
mc\frac{du_{i}}{ds}=\frac{e}{c}\left(\frac{\partial A_{k}}{\partial x^{i}}-\frac{\partial A_{i}}{\partial x^{k}}\right)u^{k}
\]

\end_inset

and we define now for the first time
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{ik}=\frac{\partial A_{k}}{\partial x^{i}}-\frac{\partial A_{i}}{\partial x^{k}}
\]

\end_inset

the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor!
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You can find 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ik}$
\end_inset

 in terms of field strengths by simply using 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=(\phi,\mathbf{A})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
According to section 6, you can then also write 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ik}=(\mathbf{E,\, H}),\, F^{ik}=(-\mathbf{E,\, H})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
<properties skipped> 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The next step is then to find the generalized momentum.
 That's simple as it comes from the other part (non-integral).
 We then do the old trick.
 Find 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta S/\delta x^{i}$
\end_inset

 and call it 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{i}$
\end_inset

 and get the relation required.
