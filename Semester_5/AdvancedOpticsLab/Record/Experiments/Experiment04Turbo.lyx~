Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with a classical description of the Zeeman Splitting and Polarization,
 beginning with justifying how we can model the Atom as a harmonic oscillator.
 Next, we'll discuss the Fabry Parot device and its basics.
 We'll then go on to discuss how it operates to produce fringes in various
 setups.
 We then briefly mention the constant deviation spectrometer and finally,
 discuss the setup of the two related experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Classical Description of Zeeman Splitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modeling the Atom as a harmonic oscillator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a simple atomic system with a heavy nucleus and a light electron.
 In the rest frame of the electron, at equilibrium we can write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a_{0}=0=\frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r_{0}}-\frac{kq^{2}}{r_{0}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

where radially inwards direction has been taken as negative and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the orbit.
 However, if we displace the the electron from its equilibrium trajectory,
 and assume the velocity remains unchanged, we can write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a=\frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r_{0}+r}-\frac{kq^{2}}{\left(r_{0}+r\right)^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

We can now taylor expand both the force term and the pseudo force to obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a=m_{e}v^{2}\left(\frac{1}{r_{0}}-\frac{r}{r_{0}^{2}}+\frac{r^{2}}{r_{0}^{3}}+\ldots\right)-kq^{2}\left(\frac{1}{r_{0}^{2}}-\frac{2r}{r_{0}^{3}}+\frac{3r^{2}}{r_{0}^{4}}+\ldots\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the purturbation from the equilibrium point (radially outward corresponds
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $r>0$
\end_inset

).
 Keeping only leading order terms and applying the equilibrium relation,
 we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a=\left(-\frac{mv^{2}}{r_{0}}+\frac{2kq^{2}}{r_{0}^{3}}\right)r=-m\omega_{0}^{2}r
\]

\end_inset

where we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega_{0}^{2}\equiv\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r_{0}}-\frac{2kq^{2}}{mr_{0}^{3}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Although we haven't shown 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 to be real, we assume it to be so.
 This explains why we can model to first order, a simple (hydrogen) atom,
 as a harmonic oscillator.

Prashansa's doing the classical description part
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than the inconsistencies of the assumptions, the fact that we need
 a discharge tube for observing the effect is not explained.
 For the purposes of this experiment, postponing the precise quantum mechanical
 description for later, I would just state that radiation we observe is
 when the electron jumps down an `orbit'.
 This essentially means that two given `orbit' is split and due to selection
 rules, we see only three wavelengths of radiation, shifted up, shifted
 down and the original (before application of the magnetic field).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another peculiar result seems to be that the eigenvector passes through
 the centre of the atom! This is a sort of projection, or so we were told.
 We weren't able to identify the source of this error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fabry Parot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a very elegent device.
 This harnesses a principle very similar to that of the interferometer.
 Instead of explaining in words, let's derive it straight away.
 Consider the following diagram.
 Consider a ray incident on the etelon at an angel 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with respect to the outward normal of the first surface.
 As shown, the virtual ray (with respect to the second surface) can be construct
ed a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $2d$
\end_inset

 behind the real ray.
 Considering that the distance between the screen and the etelon, 
\begin_inset Formula $D\gg d$
\end_inset

, to see interference we simply need to consider the path difference between
 these two rays, along a plane whos normal coincides with the ray.
 As shown in the diagram, it follows this distance is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\lambda=2d\cos\theta
\]

\end_inset

This now has very interesting repurcursions.
 If you have a monochromatic point source incident, depending on the angle
 of a ray with the normal of the etelon surface, you would get a path difference.
 This results in the formation of circular fringes with constructive interferenc
e happening on specific radii (explicit calculations have been done in the
 next experiment).
 If there was another monochromatic source at the same location, you would
 again get a circular pattern corresponding to the new wavelength.
 Keep this in mind.
 We'll use this property often.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The effect of sources and lenses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand in some detail what happens under the permutation
 of the following conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Monochromatic Source
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extended
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Lens
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Before (the source is on the focal plane)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After (if you remove the lens and look directly, it is equivalent, the eye
 has a lens)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
[not discussed] Eye after lens
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{3}=8$
\end_inset

 possibilities.
 Let's do them all.
 Consider a Monochromatic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Point Source, without any lens
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This was discussed earlier in this section.
 The result is 
\emph on
circular fringes
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extended Source, without any lens
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The point source and the etelon can be effectively treated as two extended
 sources, 
\begin_inset Formula $2d$
\end_inset

 distance apart (
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is as usual, the distance between the mirrors of the etelon).
 Using superposition, we can claim the pattern should be a superposition
 of multiple circular fringes, corresponding to everypoint of the source.
 Effectively, 
\emph on
no pattern
\emph default
 should be visible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Point Source, with a lens before, but none after
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The result is that all the light rays incident on the etelon would be parallel.
 Thus a uniform intensity pattern should be obtained, and changing the angle
 of the etelon with respect to the principle axis of the lens (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

) should yield 
\emph on
different uniform intensitites
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extended Source, with a lens before, but none after
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In this case, each point on the extended source is mapped to a parallel
 light beam of a fixed angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with respect to the principle axis, as a function of its (the point's)
 distance from the principle axis.
 The etelon will simply add a phase difference of 
\begin_inset Formula $2d\cos\theta$
\end_inset

 to a beam of a given orientation.
 Since there's no lens after, all these will fall on a screen and result
 in a 
\emph on
uniform intensity, independent of the orientation of the etelon
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Point Source, with a lens before and a lens after
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The image obtained will be that of a 
\emph on
single point
\emph default
, except it would be either bright or dark, 
\emph on
depending on the orientation
\emph default
 of the etelon (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extended Source, with a lens before and a lens after
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The analysis from the previous part follows.
 The other lens focusses parallel beams on different points on the focal
 plane, essentially mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 to position.
 Since the phase difference depended on angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, thus different points on the screen would be bright or dark, depending
 on its value.
 Symmetry considerations immediately tell us that the pattern will be 
\emph on
circular fringes
\emph default
 (may be cropped though, depending on the shape of the extended source).
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

[`Prism' zeeman like]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Point Source, without a lens before, but with a lens after
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is perhaps the most non-trivial case.
 Again, we effectively have two point sources, but they are followed by
 a lens (both points are farther away from 
\begin_inset Formula $2F$
\end_inset

).
 Using the limiting size case, one can find the resultant position of the
 image for both points.
 Now the problem has been significantly been simplified.
 Given some position of the screen (taken to be the focal plane of the lens
 here), for any given point on the screen, we construct two lines (representing
 the rays); the first joining the first point's image and the screen point
 and the second joining the second point's image and the screen point.
 Extending this line, we can find the point of intersection with the lens.
 Now we connect the intersection of the first line with the lens, with a
 line to the first source point.
 Similarly for the second point we repeat the procedure.
 Using this, one can calculate the path difference between the two rays
 that superpose on the screen.
 Without quantifying, from the symmetry, it is clear that a 
\emph on
circular pattern
\emph default
 will again be obtained in this case.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

[`TV' Zeeman like if you consider the source to be a point source]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extended Source, without a lens before, but with a lens after
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Here again, a 
\emph on
circular pattern
\emph default
 is obtained.
 This can be easily understood again by considering two extended sources.
 Now we consider only parallel beams coming from the corresponding points
 of the two sources, for other beams (non parallel) will either not be focussed
 or (different points, but parallel) not coherent.
 As earlier, the etelon will add a phase difference depending on the angle
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, and the lens will converge at a location, depending again on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we get the aforesaid pattern.

[Michelson, `TV' Zeeman like]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note however that if the object is placed between 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2F$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the focal point of the lens) then one can simply substitute the source
 to be placed at the point where the image will be formed, had a screen
 been placed there; then the setup can be matched to the possibilities given
 above and proceed accordingly.
 Further, in case of a point source along the principle axis, we can find
 the image position by first finding the same for an extended source and
 then take its size limit to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Constant Deviation Spectrometer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a usual spectrometer, the wavelength resolved beam is not parallel.
 This uses a prism as shown below (TODO: Complete this).
 This prism produces a parallel resolved beam.
 The details haven't been worked out for this part of the apparatus wasn't
 used for calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The `TV' Zeeman (polarization)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The setup consists of an electromagnet, built with two coils and a mercury
 cadmium lamp placed in the centre.
 The light can be seen through the axis of the coils as well as through
 a direction perpendicular to it.
 This assembly is mounted on a rotatable, well, mount.
 Adjacent to the mount, there's an optical bench.
 The bench has a lens that results (eventually) in a diverging beam.
 This is followed by the all glorious etelon.
 Then we have two polarizers which are then viewed through a magnifier on
 the screen using a camera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now understand what is happening.
 We start without polarisers.
 This is the same as an extended source without a lens before (the object
 is not at the focus of the lens) and a lens after.
 However, the source is not monochromatic, instead it has three wavelengths.
 Their circular patterns superimpose.
 Further, as explained in the earlier sections, the different frequencies
 are polarized differently.
 The polarized can be inserted to block lights of specific frequencies and
 the fringe pattern correspoding to that wavelength dissapears; resulting
 in a higher contrast pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mini Procedure and Observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The `Prism' Zeeman (splitting)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The setup consists of collimeter, a special constant deviation prism, and
 a telescope.
 The collimeter has an adjustable slit width.
 Incident to this can either be a sodium or mercury lamp, or a Neon discharge
 tube, placed between two coils of an electromagnet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us look at what is happening.
 The setup starts with converting the incident light into the shape of the
 slit.
 Then this light is passed through the collimeter.
 The collimeter is focussed such that the point source is in its focal plane
 (this is leading to a type 6 setup).
 This is then incident on the prism, which does two things.
 It guides the light into the telescope; and it spatially displaces different
 wavelengths.
 So effectively, the different frequencies have become spatially displaced
 sources.
 Since the shape of the extended source is a slit, introduction of an etelon
 results in the creation of slits in the line (instead of the circular fringes).
 Upon application of the magnetic field, a single frequency splits into
 three, and so does the corresponding pattern.
 What remains to show is that this splitting distance is directly proportional
 to the applied magnetic field, and that was the experiment we performed.
