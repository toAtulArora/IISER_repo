Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll start with a classical inspiration for existence of zeeman splitting
 and how we can apply to hydrogen like atoms and the kind of .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll then discuss how the fabry perot device works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll then talk about why it is that we need a discharge tube to observe
 the zeeman effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then i'll go on to derive the quantum mechanical description (basically
 the derivaiton is not so much physics as is simple algebra)

Finally I'll

Classical Description of Zeeman Splitting

\begin_layout Subsection
Modeling the Atom as a harmonic oscillator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a simple atomic system with a heavy nucleus and a light electron.
 In the rest frame of the electron, at equilibrium we can write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a_{0}=0=\frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r_{0}}-\frac{kq^{2}}{r_{0}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

where radially inwards direction has been taken as negative.
 However, if we displace the the electron from its equilibrium trajectory,
 and assume the velocity remains unchanged, we can write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a=\frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r_{0}+r}-\frac{kq^{2}}{\left(r_{0}+r\right)^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

We can now taylor expand both the force term and the pseudo force to obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a=m_{e}v^{2}\left(\frac{1}{r_{0}}-\frac{r}{r_{0}^{2}}+\frac{r^{2}}{r_{0}^{3}}+\ldots\right)-kq^{2}\left(\frac{1}{r_{0}^{2}}-\frac{2r}{r_{0}^{3}}+\frac{3r^{2}}{r_{0}^{4}}+\ldots\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the purturbation from the equilibrium point (radially outward corresponds
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $r>0$
\end_inset

).
 Keeping only leading order terms and applying the equilibrium relation,
 we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{e}a=\left(-\frac{mv^{2}}{r_{0}}+\frac{2kq^{2}}{r_{0}^{3}}\right)r=-m\omega_{0}^{2}r
\]

\end_inset

where we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega_{0}^{2}\equiv\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r_{0}}-\frac{2kq^{2}}{mr_{0}^{3}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Although we haven't shown 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 to be real, we assume it to be so.
 This explains why we can model to first order, a simple (hydrogen) atom,
 as a harmonic oscillator.

Prashansa's doing the classical description part
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fabry Parot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a very elegent device.
 This harnesses a principle very similar to that of the interferometer.
 Instead of explaining in words, let's derive it straight away.
 Consider the following diagram.
 Consider a ray incident on the etelon at an angel 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with respect to the outward normal of the first surface.
 As shown, the virtual ray (with respect to the second surface) can be construct
ed a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $2d$
\end_inset

 behind the real ray.
 Considering that the distance between the screen and the etelon, 
\begin_inset Formula $D\gg d$
\end_inset

, to see interference we simply need to consider the path difference between
 these two rays, along a plane whos normal coincides with the ray.
 As shown in the diagram, it follows this distance is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\lambda=2d\cos\theta
\]

\end_inset

This now has very interesting repurcursions.
 If you have a monochromatic point source incident, depending on the angle
 of a ray with the normal of the etelon surface, you would get a path difference.
 This results in the formation of circular fringes with constructive interferenc
e happening on specific radii (explicit calculations have been done in the
 next experiment).
 If the source was dichromatic, you would again get a circular pattern correspon
