\section{Theory}
	Certain assumptions made in the following discussion have been explicitly stated here for clarity.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The diffraction grating formed has almost zero thickness
		\item A diffraction pattern is observed only when a standing wave is produced
		\item Snell's law can be ignored in the consideration of the diffraction pattern
	\end{enumerate}
	The idea of the experiment is to estimate the speed of sound in distilled water, by producing an acoustic diffraction grating. The setup is as shown in \autoref{e2_setup}.
