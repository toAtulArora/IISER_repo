\section{Sentimental Introduction}
	Science often seems like a blackbox that relates observables. Even more often, it is rather convenient to lose touch of observables altogether, and wander in the blackbox. Performing an experiment, gets one closer to nature, to the roots of the subject.\footnote{This section can be skipped, without any loss of continuity.}

\section{The Journey}
	This experiment wasn't started from scratch. My guide, \myProf, had already worked with a team and created the Dipoles as described earlier. The team had also worked on the image detection algorithms, but their work wasn't usable.
