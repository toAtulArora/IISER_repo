% Despite numerous attempts we have failed at \emph{seeing} the microscopic world; a consequence often dressed as the `uncertainty principle'. It has been attempted here, to reconstruct a rather simple microscopic structure; to \emph{see} what happens for ourselves.
Atoms and molecules are far too small to be observable as individual entities, with our eyes alone. Scientists have come a long way at understanding \emph{their} world. It has been attempted to recreate a specific micro-structure, at a scale where we can directly observe it.

The configuration we've studied here, is that of a Magnetic Dipole Lattice, viz. Magnetic Dipoles that can only rotate about their axis, placed on a grid. Their physics by itself is rather interesting and can be simulated to observe the dynamics. The experiment is expected to show the same dynamics, that of the microscopic world, only directly observable.

TODO: Complete this part after understanding the physics and simulations on the system.
