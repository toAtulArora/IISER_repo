% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

For the investigation of validity of the Lotka-Volterra model for competition between species, a simple competition was setup between two species of Paramecia which are phenotypically distinguishable. It was found that both these species could co-exist and further, it was observed that their phenotypes began to `interchange'. An evolution study was planned to test if differentially speedening the process of evolution for one species could lead to its better relative survival.

\section{Introduction}
  Evolutionary biology often explains the observed and very rarely predicts, roughly speaking. This experiment was aimed at putting evolutionary ideas to work for predicting the outcome of an experiment. We have been taught that organisms have co-evolved and it therefore makes sense to imagine that the organisms that could evolve faster, would've out-survived their competitors. To test this, we chalked out a two stage plan. The first was to test the prevailing Lotka-Volterra model for competition between two species of \emph{Paramecium}. Second stage was to increase the rate of evolution, selectively for one species and observe the densities, as they compete.

\section{Materials}
  For setting up one culture of a 100 mL volume, we used:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Beaker/Conical flask 100 mL
    \item Elix Water (roughly 100 mL)
    \item Yeast Powder (0.04 g per 100 mL)
    \item Wheat Beads (3-4 per 100 mL)    
    \item \emph{Paramecium} Sample
  \end{enumerate}
  For finding the Paramecia from the `wild', the following were used
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Gloves
    \item Centrifuge Tubes (essentially seal-able containers)
    \item Pro-pipetter
    \item Permanent Marker
  \end{enumerate}
\section{Method}
  \subsection{Counting \emph{Paramecium}}
    Since counting is the heart of this experiment, repeatability was a very important concern. We did the following to ensure reliability of the data.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Volume for counting was taken to be very small ( $10\mu L$ initially, and then dropped to $5\mu L$ finally) to ensure the total number of \emph{Paramecium} are readily countable.
      \item Videos were recorded using a digital camcorder, by pointing it through the lens of the eye piece of the Ziess microscope. \footnote{The process involved careful, strategic positioning of the right kind of camera, which was discovered experimentally}
    \end{enumerate}
    We took a total of $100\mu L$ volume from the sample to estimate the densities. The counting was done manually.
  \subsection{Creating the culture}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Took $40mL$ of Elix water in the flask.
      \item Added 4 wheat seeds to the beaker and boiled it for 2 minutes, using a micro-wave oven.
      \item Further, to it, $0.04g$ of finely grinded yeast powder was added immediately and stirred
      \item The contents of the beaker were cooled to room temperature.
      \item To this, the \emph{Paramecium} culture was added and mixed
      \item The volume was made $100mL$ by adding Elix water and mixed gently.
      \item The culture created was incubated at $25^oC$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{Finding the Paramecia}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item At  first we decided a location like a small pond, puddle, etc. and then after wearing gloves, extracted some water using pipette and pro-pipetter and dumped the water in a fresh centrifuge tube and marked it using appropriate label.
      \item We repeated the above procedure for different depths and also at various other locations in the water body.
      \item Then we took a drop of water from each tube in a glass slide and observed it under a microscope and we reported our observations.
      \item Once, a particular species of \emph{paramecium} was found, we reported it to Dr. N.G. Prasad \footnote{He was our Biology Lab Course's Insructor} and then we had setup the cultures.
    \end{enumerate}
\section{Apparatus}
  The following were available and used from the Biology Teaching Laboratory.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Zeiss Stemi DV4
    \item Pathological Microscope
  \end{enumerate}
\section{Experimental Procedure}  
  The experiment was designed to run in two stages. The first stage was intended to verify a standard result and the second to test an aspect of evolution.\par
  For both stages, we need model organisms. We had found \emph{Paramecium} in a total of 10 samples collected from the Nala and nearby puddles. $50mL$ cultures were made for each of the 10 samples. (refer Materials and methods ) To every $40mL$ of water, $10mL$ of the sample water was added. These cultures were checked after two days of having set up. 
  \par
  Our requirement was to have two samples of Paramecia which were phenotypically (for instance size) distinguishable. We observed relatively large \emph{Paramecium} in one of the samples collected from the Nala, but we did not find \emph{Paramecium} which were much smaller in size than this. So, we used another species of \emph{Paramecium}, available with another group in our lab, which had a fairly smaller size.
  \par
  We set up $100mL$ cultures for both of these \emph{Paramecium} species. The cultures are referred to as:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Flask P: small \emph{Paramecium}
    \item Flask Q: large \emph{Paramecium}.
  \end{enumerate}
  Both the flasks were checked on the next day.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Flask P: Under 4X, only \emph{Paramecium} were seen.
    \item Flask Q: Under 4X, small round organisms (referred to as `Organism X') were seen in high numbers apart from the large \emph{Paramecium}.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection*{Isolating \emph{Paramecium} from Flask Q}
  $10uL$ of the culture was taken on a glass slide. The drop was diluted with $200uL$ of water. Under 4X magnification, organism X were seen in the bottom part of the drop, while the \emph{Paramecium} were seen floating on the top part. We used a $20\mu L$ micro-pipette, to carefully extract the top part of the drop. This isolated drop was used to set up a $25mL$ culture. However, on the following day, both organism X and the \emph{Paramecium} were found in significant numbers in the flask. Thus the large \emph{Paramecium} could not be isolated.
  
  \subsection*{Motivation behind next step}
  In competition, the presence of the organism X can be taken as a component of the environment.

  \subsection{Stage 1: Setting up the Cultures for \emph{Paramecium} Competition Study}
  Both the Paramecia cultures were allowed to grow for about 7 days after which we safely assumed that both the populations had reached their corresponding carrying capacities.
  We determined the population densities of Flask P and Flask Q, which essentially gave us the values of their carrying capacities, $K_1$ and $K_2$.
  \par
  Two replicates were set up; namely Flask A and Flask B, with the following parameters
  \par
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Total volume: $50 mL$
    \item Volume of Flask P culture added: $2.29 mL$
    \item Volume of Flask Q culture added: $3.92 mL$
    \item Ambient temperature of the cultures: $25^oC$
  \end{enumerate}
  They were counted daily for a period of 14 days.
  \par
  
  \subsection{Stage 2: Differentially Speeding up Evolution}
  For the next stage, our objective was to speed up evolution for the species which was not competent \footnote{In case only one species survives, the not competent refers to the one that perished. In case both do, the not competent is the one that is not dominant in number.} To achieve this, it was decided to expose a set of \emph{Paramecium} to UV, to increase mutation rate, and then immediately use this for competition. This step was expected to increase the variation, and thereby speed up evolution, of the said species. The competition study from here on was to be carried out as described in the first stage.

\section{Observations}
  The observations were made daily for a period 14 days, however not necessarily at at the same time of the day. The time was noted and adjusted for, in the plots drawn.
  \subsection{Densities}
    Initial exponential growth was observed in both flasks. Flask A showed a distinct dominance of the larger Paramecia, while in Flask B, no such comment can be made.
    \par
    Please refer to table \ref{density_data_A} and \ref{density_data_B} for details.
    Graph \ref{density_graph_A} and \ref{density_graph_B} correspond to the observations given in the table.

    \end{figure}
  \subsection{Qualitative Observations}
    There were two kinds of distinctions between the \emph{Paramecium} species that could be observed initially.
    \par
    Size: The sizes were roughly in the ratio 3:4
    \par
    Phenotypic: The smaller one, had a characteristic white spot at the extreme of its body, which was opposite to it's direction of movement. The larger one had, on a large scale, uniform distribution of the white colouration.
    \par
    However, afterwards, the following distinctions were observed:
    \par
    Size: There were atleast three different sizes \footnote{These are most likely not `baby' Paramecia since in the stock culture, the `baby' Paramecia were not dominantly visible}
    \par
    Phenotypic: The white spot could be seen at times, at the characteristic location for both large and small \emph{Paramecium}. It is implied here, that there were both large and small Paramecia, that didn't have any clear spot.    
    \subsubsection*{Spore Formation}
      Since the water drop size was small, so after evaporation, at extremely low volumes \footnote{when the surface area approximately equalled the volume}, the Paramecia were observed to fuse into one another, viz. conjugate.
    \subsubsection*{Realtime Size Change}
      Certain Paramecia, increased their size, while under observation.

\section{Result and Discussion}
  The experiment failed in the classical sense of the word, since the observations were `negative', yet non-trivial. Our first objective was to test the Lotka-Volterra model for two species of Paramecia, which could not be accomplished since the phenotypic distinction between the Paramecia seems to have distorted, to render the results unreliable. While this makes the experiment non-conclusive in the testing of the model, it does expose the unexpected response to adverse situations, of the Paramecia, which we have neither heard of, nor studied so far.
