\chapter*{Abstract}
This report covers experiments to investigate behaviour of birds in the campus, study Winogradsky columns to understand micro-organisms and their habitats, explore the consequences of co-evolution of Bees, the pollinators, with multi-coloured single species of a flower, analyze the distribution of plants in a given area by two experimental methods, line transect and quadrat sampling, and identify the relation between investment in somatic growth and reproductive growth by plants of various species. [[Bird behaviour needs to be updated here]]. Bees were found to be preferentially attracted to certain coloured flowers of the same species. Quadrat sampling revealed a \emph{linear} relation between investment in growth and investment in reproduction, by plants of the same species which happens to be the simplest most elegant and surprising result for the team.
