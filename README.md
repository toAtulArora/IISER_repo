LATEST ON RECORD

Working at NPL on an experiment that should help understand the dynamics of a 2D dipole lattice!

OLD INTRODUCTION
--

This repository contains all Recorded Academic Progress made by me for completion of courses @ IISER M, that I've shared.

I hope to make all the information accessible for assisting, in whichever way, anyone who's interested.

Although this repository was created on August 10, 2012, I would gradually upload all the usable information from the previous years for completion.

CV

I don't quite have enough achievements as yet, but we live with what we have.

SUMMER '13 TIMELINE
--
* May 16, Thursday: Working on dipole detection.

* May 15, Wednesday: The magnetic lifting worked, but friction reduction failed. Rather interestingly the dipole would align to the suspension magnet's field. Plus, today the spot recognition algorithm was finalized and it seemd to be perfect.

* May 14, Tuesday: Trying to get the webcam to work, eventually acceded to installing everything on a desktop machine. Worked on reducing the friction further

* May 13, Monday: Completed the proof of concept version of the latticeAnlyser. Tomorrow we plan to print the coloured ovals and test

** May 11 and 12, Saturday and Sunday: Read the opencv tutorials when the algorithms started appearing and fitting the bill!

* May 10, Friday: Continued with the setup, finetuning, installing other applications, making a documentation alongside for better support next time, added a shared folder between windows and linux

* May 9, Thursday: Managed to get a few things up and running, still setting up ubuntu to run with hardware acceleration, failed at trying to get the webcam to work, installed the build tools, opencv etc.

* May 8, Wednesday: Met with Dr. X (forgot the name of the person at NPL I'm working with) and concluded OpenCV and linux are what I'll use. Initiated the downloading of required applications, including virtual box and an ubuntu image
