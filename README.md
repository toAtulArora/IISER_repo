INTRODUCTION
--

This repository contains all Recorded Academic Progress made by me for completion of courses @ IISER M, that I've shared.

I hope to make all the information accessible for assisting, in whichever way, anyone who's interested.

Although this repository was created on August 10, 2012, I would gradually upload all the usable information from the previous years for completion.
