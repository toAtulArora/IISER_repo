I scintillation mechanism in inorganic crystlas with activators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in inorganic compounds, energy states are determined by the structure of
 the crystal lattice.
 There are only discrete energy levels available : valence band, conduction
 band and the forbidden band.
 The valence badn has electrons in the bound states, while the conduction
 band has those electrons which have the energy to migrate through the crystal;
 the forbidden band is the intermediate band of energies where no electrons
 are found in the pure state of crystal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When energy is absorbed, an electron moves from the valence band to the
 conduction band leaving a hole behind.
 In a pure crystal, de-excitation of such an electron back to valence band
 is usually an inefficient process, therefore there is no release of a photon.
 In order to increase this probability of visible photon emission during
 de-excitation, a small amount of impurity called an activator is added.
 This activator creates special sites ie energy states within the forbidden
 band called luminescence centers or recombination centers.
 Now the energy is less than the forbidden gap, which can now produce a
 photon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
many electron hole pairs are created in the process of excitation of electrons
 from the valence to the conduction band.
 The hole can now easily drift to activator site since its ionisation energy
 is low.
 An electron free to migrate, finds and drops into the ionised activator
 site creating a neutral configuration.
 If this activator site is an excited configuration with allowed transition
 to ground state, then de-excitation is a quick process and is accompanied
 by photon emission.
 This photon can be in the visible range depending on the choice of activators.
 If the activator site is configured for a forbidden transition, then it
 requires an increment of energy

This experiment employs a sodium iodide detector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
scintillation spectroscopy of gamma radiation was ushered in by the discovery
 of sodium iodide's ability to produce large scintillation output as compared
 to organic counterparts, by Robert Hofstader in 1948.
 large ingots containing 10 raised to power -3 mole fraction of thallium
 as activator can be produced using high quality sodium iodide
