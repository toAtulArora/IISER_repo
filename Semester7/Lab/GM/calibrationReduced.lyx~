\begin_layout Title
Counting radioactive decay events using a GM Tube
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we show that there exist circumstances in which the Geiger Muller Tube
 can be used to reliably count the number of beta decay events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Gieger Muller tube is a device filled with gas which counts individual
 ionising events.
 It consists of anode surrounded by a metal cylinder that is the cathode.
 The gas filled in the tube is a mixture of rare gases and a quenching agent.
 The quanta entering the tube and colliding with the gas molecules initiate
 the ionising events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quenching is the termination of the ionisation of the current pulse in the
 GM tube.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plateau Threshold Voltage is the starting voltage applied to the GM tube
 at which pulses just appear and the apparatus starts counting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plateau is the part of the GM characteristic curve over which the counts
 are predominantly independent of the applied voltage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plateau Length is the range of applied voltage over which the plateau region
 extends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upper Threshold Voltage is the highest voltage upto which the plateau region
 remains, beyond which counts increase substantially with applied voltage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plateau Slope is the slope of the curve in the plateau region, which quantifies
 the change in counts with the change in applied voltage, expressed in percentag
e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Operating Voltage is the voltage at which the apparatus should be preferably
 used, is taken to be at the middle of the plateau region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Background Counts are the counts registered without the source, which may
 be due to cosmic rays and other surrounding sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM Tube described in the previous section is powered using a 220V source.
 A radioactive source (Cs; a 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 source) was placed about 2 cm from the window of the Tube.
 An electronic device designed to count the number of detection events was
 initialized to count for 60 seconds.
 The voltage being applied to the GM Tube was varied from 350V to 650V.
 These numbers were determined by the following two procedures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The voltage was increased continuously but slowly while ensuring that the
 counts display on the electronic device reads zero.
 The voltage at which the first count is found gives a rough estimate of
 where to start; in this case 350V.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other value of the voltage was found by noting that the counts suddenly
 shoot up at around this value.
 Going beyond this risks reduction in the life of or permanent destruction
 the tube.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the determination of appropriate range of operation, three sets of
 counts were noted twice for voltage values incremented in steps of 30V.
 Once with the source, and once without.
 The background thus found was subtracted and a graph of voltage versus
 counts was plotted and various regions identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plateau threshold voltage was observed to be at 380V.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plateau region extends upto 590V after which a sharp beginning of the
 discharge region can be noticed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plateau length is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $(590+380)V$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $=210V$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating voltage 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{O}$
\end_inset

 is defined as the average of the plateau region voltages, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{O}=\frac{1}{2}(590+380)=485V
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope of the plateau is given as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{N_{2}-N_{1}}{V_{2}-V_{1}}\times100=\frac{16.67}{100}\times100=7.93\%
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph plotted, appropriately shows the plateau region, with a length
 of 210V.
 Thus the operation voltage was found to be 485V.
