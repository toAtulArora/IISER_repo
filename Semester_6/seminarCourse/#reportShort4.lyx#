\begin_layout Abstract
I had the view earlier that attending seminars is not nearly as important
 as spending time learning concepts systematically.
 In the recent past, I have been made to realize that too much focusing
 also is not a good idea.
 Thus, the topics that I am interested in but do not intend to study systematica
lly in the perceivable future, I can learn about through seminars.
 The topics maybe sub topics in physics or those of other disciplines.
 Making connections this way is helpful and accelerates learning.
 So far, it has indeed been the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The following discussions have been severely shortened and may therefore
 not be suitable for understanding the topics.
 However, the objective here is to convey the idea behind the talks with
 very few words.
 I hope in the process clarity hasn't been sacrificed.

\begin_layout Section
Why a Quantum Theory of Gravity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The when, where and who | facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The talk was given by Prof.
 G.
 Date from IMSc, Chennai, in LH-3 of the Lecture Hall Complex, IISER M,
 on Wednesday, March 26, 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation for attending | feelings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our QFT instructor, Dr.
 Sudipta, informed us and recommended that we attend it.
 That's one.
 Then I remember reading an eminent scientist say that we are fortunate
 to have been born at a time when problems in physics existed and we didn't
 have to create them.
 I feel that Quantum Theory of Gravity is the one for us.
 It's even more motivating to see that there was a time when even STR and
 QM couldn't be combined consistently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
This I could understand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker opened with `Quantum Gravity is the fiery marriage of General
 Relativity and Quantum Mechanics'.
 The pursuit he said is not purely hypothetical, nor a problem of unexplained
 data.
 Wheeler's description of the final state of a star is amongst one of the
 reasons why such a theory would be necessary.*
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{\mu\nu}(g)-\frac{1}{2}R(g)g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{C^{4}}T_{\mu\upsilon}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There've been two revolutions in physics; Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.
 In General Relativity the notion of causality gets dynamical and metrical
 properties can also change.
 The combination of special relativity and Quantum Mechanics is Quantum
 Field Theory.
 QFT is consistent with fixed causality defined by minkowski space-time,
 but assumes that causal structures can be defined at arbitrarily small
 lengths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next the speaker talked about the basic assumptions of GR.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
space-time is defined by a 4d manifold and its metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 (-ve determinant).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stress tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, which describes the matter distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metric imposes a causal structure on time like events in their local
 neighbourhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remarks: Given a metric, at any point, you can define a set of tangent vectors.
 These can be classified as timelike, spacelike or null (or Prashansa like,
 viz.
 going nowhere).
 Corresponding geodesics determine which evens can influence each other
 causally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Einstein's equation is only a local PDE and determines solution space-times
 only locally.
 Extended solutions are not guaranteed to be causal without imposing extra
 conditions.
 Then the speaker talked about predictability, that is events can be divided
 into cause and effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next he talked about time orientability, strong causality and stable causality.
 He stated that causality is not automatic, so time-orientable space times
 are a subset of solutions of einstein's equation.
 An example is given in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strong Causality: We can impose strong causality else its possible to have
 future curves that come arbitrarily close to the existing events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stable Causality: Imposing stable causality on the other hand would mean
 that spacelike and timelike do not interchange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global Hyperbolicity: space-times which admit spacelike hypersurface whose
 domain of dependence is the entire space-time are globally hyperbolic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, global hyperbolicity automatically ensures causal stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have a space-time with predictability, we can construct globally hyperbolic
 space-time (take a spacelike hyper surface, define domain of depndence
 to be the full space-time, it abruptly ends.
 You extend it, how far? maximally possible).
 However, a predictable space-time should be an inextendable/globally hyperbolic
 solution of einstein's equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker then went on to describe a slightly technical topic, `Property
 of Globally Hyperbolic Space Times'.
 Consider a space 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\Sigma,q)$
\end_inset

 of causal curves, emanating from a hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and passing through a point 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to its future.
 Its a theorem that a curve of maximum proper time is a geodesic without
 any `conjugate point' between 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next the speaker digressed to talk about a `Bundle of Time like Geodesics'.
 Imagine a cloud of particles freely `falling' in a given space time.
 These will be described by a bungle of time-like geodesics.
 Their cross section in general can undergo 1.
 Shearing, 2.
 Twist or 3.
 Expansion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
`Raychaudhuri Equations and Conjugate Points' was discussed next.
 This I couldn't understand much however what is known that there arises
 a contradiction related to the existence of a singularity which is resolved
 by concluding that the geodesic must be incomplete, viz.
 the observer's world line must end abruptly.
 The details have been skipped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blackholes and Thermodynamics were discussed next.
 General relativity contains another class of intriguing solutions - Black
 holes - space-times which have event horizons.
 A stationary black hole can be described in terms of parameters like mass
 (
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

), angular momentum (
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

) and charge (
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

).
 The event horizon is similarly described by the (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) area, (
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) angular velocity and (Potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 electrostatic potential).
 They have a surface gravity (
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

) which is a constant over the horizon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If these are disturbed by any astrophysical process, they continue to remain
 black hole with changed values of their parameters, such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta M=\frac{K}{8\pi}\delta A+\Omega\delta J+\phi\delta Q,\,\delta A\geq0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a striking similarity to classical thermodynamics and there's no
 reason why blackholes should obey this.
 But continuing the analogy suggests that surface gavity ~ temperature and
 area ~ entropy.
 So by this analogy we expect that being a hot body, black-holes should
 radiate but they don't let anything escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hawking pointed out that this is true only classically.
 Because of quantum fluctuations present n the horizon of the black hole,
 it has a temperature and entropy given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=\frac{kGh}{2\pi},\,\, S=\frac{A}{4Gh}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next part was rather interesting.
 Since we understand the origin of entropy from statistics of a finite number
 of entities, it seems to suggest that the horizons must have some atomic
 structure, and they must be purely geometric objects, viz.
 the`atoms' must be atoms of geometry.
 Maybe space-time geometry is discrete.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hints us to the conclusion that perhaps continuum geometry is inadequate
 near high curvature regions and that geometry may be discrete.
 This begins the framework of quantum.
 So what would be the goal of such a framework? It should reproduce the
 classical space-time approximately at the bare minimum.
 Further it should atleast resolve the curvature singularities and provide
 an explanation of the blackhole entropy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So where's the problem, well GR has a property of general covariance which
 makes it a gauge theory and results in loss of determinism.
 Further, if space-time is quantized, then `notion of `dynamics'' is hard
 to define, since time evolution needs to be interpreted differently.
 Besides, the regimes where quantum rescue is sought, involves highly dynamical,
 strong curvatures, where perturbative tools are questionable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker ended the talk with discussing the two types of approaches taken
 to solve the problem of quantization.
 The first is based on discretizing points of geometry.
 The second involves promoting space to be an operator that acts on some
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
This I'll remember
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to construct solutions to Einstein's equations such that
 locally they follow all the properties we expect but have peculiar global
 behaviour.
 Imagine making a light cone on a piece of paper and then folding it to
 make the future and past light cone match.
 Locally, everything's consistent, but globally, you're going to the past
 from the future!

The Dance Language of the Bees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The when, where and who | facts
\end_layout

 Raghavendra Gadagkar from IISc, Bangalore, in LH5 of the LHC, IISER M,
 on Thursday, March 27 2014.

 However, it turned out to be rewarding.

A Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Apis florea
\emph default
 is the species discussed in the talk.
 It is found only in Asia, and is open nesting (thus harder to domesticate).
 They are interesting as their social behaviour is not as sophisticated
 (compared to the other four major species).
 They communicate by transferring saliva and dancing, i.e.
 subject of the talk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
About these bees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within these bees, there are drones (the males), worker (essentially sterile)
 and one queen (that lays eggs).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The said bees dance only on horizontal surfaces unlike the other species.
 There are two types of dances known.
 First is called a round dance, in which the bee makes a circular motion.
 The other's called a waggle dance in which the bee transcribes an 8 shape
 with vigorous vibrations half way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Communication and Dance (the real deal)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier it was thought that waggling related to pollen being found and round
 to nectar.
 Later experiments confirmed that the waggling dance corresponded to the
 food being farther than roughly 100 m and the round to less than that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiments have confirmed that the waggle dance conveys information about
 the direction and distance of the resource found.
 They use the sun's azimuthal as reference (as it is globally stable, unlike
 the surroundings) even though it changes its location periodically.
 The bees apparently correct for this.
 Further they even update their map of the surrounding everyday and use
 that to locate the sun.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the waggle dance, during the middle part of 8, the direction in which
 the bee moves contains the direction information.
 Also during this part, the tempo of vibration codes for distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although its not known how they find the angle, the distance is measured
 not using the energy requirement as was previously thought, but using optical
 flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sophistication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These bees have evolved to use fallback mechanisms for defining the angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sun is used when its bright enough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Polarization of light on the sky is used if the sky is overcast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Local landmarks can also be used.
 They learn it each day to compensate for their change with time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Siesta; when the sun is overhead, they take time off
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various experiments were done to test color vision, co-relation between
 sugar/nectar and waggle/round dance, co-relation between wiggle and flight
 direction (Fan like experiment), that optical information is used to find
 direction, use of Sun as reference (The lamp shift experiment | miscommunicatio
n) and if dancing is sufficient to communicate information about resources
 (The robot bee experiment).

\begin_layout Standard
It was compulsory to attend atleast 2 in this series, however it turned
 out to be rather informative and interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What I understood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker in essence talked about how one would characterize various physical
 systems using geometry.
 He started by asking the question, how one would characterize surfaces,
 after showing with a series of figures.
 One way of such characterization he said was counting the number of holes.
 He then showed how various surfaces like a cup, purse etc.
 may deformed to a surface having clearly one or two (or even no) holes.
 He went on to explain why such a characterization, though intuitive is
 not always easy.
 He talked about Euler's polyhedron formula and the Gaus Bounet Theorem.
 He attempted to show some generalizations to higher dimensions, including
 the concept of derivatives.
 Specifically, he talked about Liuovilles Theorem and discussed in some
 detail the tangent space and its dual, co-tangent space.
 The fascinating part of the talk was related to the double pendulum which
 we know is chaotic.
 He explicitly showed an animation proving his point.
 He then asked us what geometry we could associate with the co-ordinate
 phase space of the setup.
 The answer was a torus.
 He then stated a result which follows from the geometric analysis that
 the hamilton's equations result in contraining the movement along geodescics
 of the torus geometry.
 This has a profound implication, the resulting motion will be periodic
 since geodesics are closed.
 This is almost impossible to see without the geometric considerations since
 we don't even have an analytic solution of the motion.
 Finally he demonstrated Euler's disc and talked about the infinite frequency
 before collapsing and discussed why this singularity is not a consequence
 of hamiltonian evolution but instead that of dissipation.
 He concluded the discussion by attempting to convince the audience that
 we can't think of logic without invoking some sort of object (geometry)
 in our heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker received criticism for not acknowledging the sources referred
 to, and for shoddy board work from the instructor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Subsection
The when, where and who | facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Ayushi Singhania (Int PhD), on Wednesday, April 23, 2014, at 9 PM in LH3
 of the LHC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation for attending
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The topic sounded like fun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What I could follow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker started with outlining her talk; introduction, history, magneto
 caloric effect, thermodynamics, advantages/disadvantages.
 She explained that the technology is based in magneto caloric effects (MCE).
 This was discovered by P.
 Weiss and it was suggested by P.
 Debey and W.
 Giaque.
 The MCE is based in changing the temperature of specific materials, by
 exposing it to changing magnetic fields.
 The phenomenon hinges on the idea that at a given temperature, the magnetic
 field causes alignment and when it is removed, the disorientation leads
 to dropping of the temperature (assuming there's no heat exchange).
 This has similarities with the Curie temperature which has electric fields
 and ferroelectric domains as analogues to their magnetic counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker motivated the functioning further by explain how thermal and
 magnetic entropy together function to drop the temperature.
 She broke down the process into four steps.
 In the first (adiabatic), magnetic field is increased.
 Since there's no exchange of heat, the net entropy is zero; the magnetic
 entropy drops and thus the temperature increases.
 In the next step, a liquid is passed that cools the system, taking away
 the heating that resulted.
 In the third step, the adiabatic demagnetization, magnetic entropy is increased
, while the thermal entropy is decreased.
 This step leads to cooling! In the final step, whatever is intended to
 be cooled is passed through and the process is repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker also did some calculations on the board to arrive at an expression
 for change in temperature, in terms of the system's parameters.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial T=-\frac{\mu_{0}T}{C_{H}}\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial T}\right)_{H}dH
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Candidate and prevalent working material for the refrigerator were discussed
 next which included alloys of gadolinium which are known to produce 3-4
 K change, per Tesla of change in magnetic field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker concluded by drawing a parallel between magnetic and conventional
 refrigeration, pointing out the role of pressure being played by the magnetic
 field in the said case.
 She discussed some advantages, such as environment friendliness and high
 efficiency (60-70%) while also listing some drawbacks such as its high
 cost and requirement of rare earth materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker was appreciated for her clarity and neat board work by the instructo
r.

Cooling by Dilution Refrigerator 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The when, where and who | facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mr.
 Subhendu Shekhar delivered the talk on Friday, April 18, 2014, in LH3,
 LHC at 6:00 PM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation for attending
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The talk was on a holiday plus I wanted to wind up the seminar work by that
 night.
 But as usual, it turned out to be informative and the principle discussed
 was rather interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What I understood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speaker started with outlining his talk.
 His first slide was about how cooling by evaporation of He-4 can only reach
 about 1.3 K.
 Below this temperature, the vapour pressure is very small and thus very
 little evaporates to facilitate the cooling.
 This issue is resolved by using mixtures of liquid He-3 and He-4.
 The dilution refrigerator works on this technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At 0.7K, the dilution refrigerator starts working.
 We start with two layers of almost pure He-3 and He-4 at 0.1K.
 He-3 starts diffusing into He-4.
 The reason for this was explained later.
 While diluting He-3 absorbs heat, thus the cooling action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This next step can be understood in analogy with the evaporation process,
 wherein we need to remove vapour for evaporation to continue.
 By mixing into the lower layer, the He-3 layer above is effectively gets
 diluted.
 In order to continue cooling, the He-3 dissolved in dilute phase must somehow
 be removed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next the speaker talked about cooling power of the system.
 Vapour pressure of He falls exponentially with decreasing temperature.
 It is possible to increase the limiting concentration above 6.6% by increasing
 pressure, he asserted.
 He went on to derive an expression for change in entropy for such a system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the realization of such a system was discussed.
 The basic principle may be described as follows.
 Like in evaporation, cooling takes place when Helium atoms move from liquid
 to vapour phase, in dilution, cooling takes place when He-3 atoms move
 form the concentrated to dilute phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now coming to the reason for diffusion/dilution; it hinges on the statistical
 characteristics of the constituents.
 He-3 is a fermion while He-4 is a boson.
 Consequently, He-3 diffuses into He-4 to minimize its Fermi energy while
 He-4 tries to gain more super-fluid condensation energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary (has been written off of one of the slides):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The helium undergoes phase separation when cooled below 0.87K giving two
 phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The specific heat of He-3 atoms is higher in the dilute phase than in the
 concentration phase of the atom goes from the concentrated to dilute phase,
 results in the `production of cold'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non-zero solubility of He-3 in He-4 even at 0K leads to cooling power which
 decreases with 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

, is much higher than cooling power of evaporation which falls exponentially
