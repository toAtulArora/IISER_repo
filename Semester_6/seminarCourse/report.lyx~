Seminar Course

\begin_layout Abstract
I had the view earlier that attending seminars is not nearly as important
 as spending time learning concepts systematically.
 In the recent past, I have been made to realize that too much focusing
 also is not a good idea.
 Thus, the topics that I am interested in but do not intend to study systematica
lly in the perceivable future, I can learn about through seminars.
 The topics maybe sub topics in physics or those of other disciplines.
 Making connections this way is helpful and accelerates learning.
 So far, it has indeed been the case.

Why a Quantum Theory of Gravity

\begin_layout Subsection
The when, where and who | facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The talk was given by Prof.
 G.
 Date from IMSc, Chennai, in LH-3 of the Lecture Hall Complex, IISER M,
 on Wednesday, March 26, 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation for attending | feelings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our QFT instructor, Dr.
 Sudipta, informed us and recommended that we attend it.
 That's one.
 Then I remember reading an eminent scientist say that we are fortunate
 to have been born at a time when problems in physics existed and we didn't
 have to create them.
 I feel that Quantum Theory of Gravity is the one for us.
 It's even more motivating to see that there was a time when even STR and
 QM couldn't be combined consistently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
This I could understand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantum Gravity is the fiery marriage of General Relativity and Quantum
 Mechanics.
 The pursuit is not purely theoretical.
 Wheeler's description of the final state of a star is amongst one of the
 reasons why such a theory would be necessary.*

\[
R_{\mu\nu}(g)-\frac{1}{2}R(g)g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{C^{4}}T_{\mu\upsilon}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
This I'll remember
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to construct solutions to Einstein's equations such that
 locally they follow all the properties we expect but have peculiar global
 behaviour.
 Imagine making a light cone on a piece of paper and then folding it to
 make the future and past light cone match.
 Locally, everything's consistent, but globally, you're going to the past
 from the future!

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Apis florea
\emph default
 is the species discussed in the talk.
 It is found only in Asia, and is open nesting (thus harder to domesticate).
 They are interesting as their social behaviour is not as sophisticated
 (compared to the other four major species).
 They communicate by transferring saliva and dancing, i.e.
 subject of the talk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Their life and Division of labour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within these bees, there are drones (the males), worker (essentially sterile)
 and one queen (that lays eggs).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Drones: They do almost nothing; wait and finally go out to find virgin queens
 in other nests and die after mating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Workers do all the work to run and maintain the system.
 Further, what they do on a given day depends on their age.

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the nest is inherited by the daughter queen and the old queen together
 with some workers takes a risky journey to find a new nest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
More about bees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The said bees dance only on horizontal surfaces unlike the other species.
 There are two types of dances known.
 First is called a round dance, in which the bee makes a circular motion.
 The other's called a waggle dance in which the bee transcribes an 8 shape
 with vigorous vibrations half way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bees are also now known to have colour vision, a rather unexpected result.
 They also have sensitivity to light's polarisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bees collect nectar which provides carbohydrate (used for building the nest)
 and pollen, their source of protein.
 Pollen they don't collect actively; it gets deposited on their bodies and
 they clean themselves to pack it tightly in their pollen baskets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Communication and Dance (the real deal)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier it was thought that waggling related to pollen being found and round
 to nectar.
 Later experiments confirmed that the waggling dance corresponded to the
 food being farther than roughly 100 m and the round to less than that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiments have confirmed that the waggle dance conveys information about
 the direction and distance of the resource found.
 They use the sun's azimuthal as reference (as it is globally stable, unlike
 the surroundings) even though it changes its location periodically.
 The bees apparently correct for this.
 Further they even update their map of the surrounding everyday and use
 that to locate the sun.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the waggle dance, during the middle part of 8, the direction in which
 the bee moves contains the direction information.
 Also during this part, the tempo of vibration codes for distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although its not known how they find the angle, the distance is measured
 not using the energy requirement as was previously thought, but using optical
 flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sophistication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These bees have evolved to use fallback mechanisms for defining the angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sun is used when its bright enough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Polarization of light on the sky is used if the sky is overcast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Local landmarks can also be used.
 They learn it each day to compensate for their change with time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Siesta; when the sun is overhead, they take time off
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Amazing Facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They 'compromise and negotiate' to converge to the direction of their new
 home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They cock their heads in the direction of the sun even when their surface
 is not horizontal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rock bees, a species of bees, fly at night and apparently use the 'would
 be' location of the sun for reference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bees have dialects; the Asian ones can understand certain other ones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Anatomy of a controversy is a book written that pokes holes in the experiments
 backing most of these claims.
 Consequently better experiments have been performed to uphold the conclusions
 presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various experiments were to test

\begin_layout Enumerate

 the published paper,

The light paths of honeybees tracked using harmonic radar provides strong
 evidence that recruits use of the directional information contained in

 emotional investment.
