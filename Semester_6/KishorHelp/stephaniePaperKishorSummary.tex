\section{Motivation}

This paper targets the following questions :
\begin{itemize}
\item In classical channels, C (capacity) is an important factor due to
the strong converse by Wolfowitz. Is there a strong converse for quantum
channels (for classical communication)?
\item Does entanglement provide any operational advantage?
\end{itemize}

\section{Prior Art}
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong converse exists for classical channels as well as quantum identity
channels.
\item Strong converse does exist if inputs are assumed to be in a tensor
product form.
\item A weak converse holds for entangled inputs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item For channels whose Holevo quantity is additive, strong converse
holds; $\exists \, \gamma>0$ such that 
\[
p_{\text{{succ}}}^{\phi}(n,R)\leq2^{-\gamma n(R-C)}
\]
where $R$ is the code rate, $\phi$ is the channel and $C$ is the
classical capacity, for sufficiently large $n$.
\item Entanglement does not provide any operational advantage.
\end{itemize}

\section{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Whether there are non-additive channels for which only a
weak converse holds.
\item Do we need better mathematics to evaluate the capacity for channels
with non-additive Holevo quantity?
\item Is there a strong converse for channels whose Holevo quantity is non-additive?\end{itemize}
