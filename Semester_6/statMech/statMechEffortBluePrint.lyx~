\begin_layout Abstract
This has been written at a time when physics majors had become too magical
 a place.
 Lets start shall we?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Unordered List
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Clausious inequality, with half the process reversible, half irreversible,
 you're able to show that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\frac{dq}{T}\le\Delta S
\]

\end_inset

then for a thermally isolated system, you say the lhs is zero and conclude
 that for such a system the entropy always increases.
 Now why wouldn't 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S=\int\frac{dq_{r}}{T}
\]

\end_inset

 also = 0 if the system is thermally isolated? [in case you've forgotten,
 you had resolved this with Diksha] 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Comment: You had also using this, shown the equivalence (partly atleast)
 of the Careothedeory's statement of the first law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Kardar's page 101, why does the first order change in entropy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta S$
\end_inset

 have to be zero for a given first order reversible change of coordinates
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is entropy really a state function even when 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dq/T$
\end_inset

 is done on an irreversible path? What happens stat mechanically?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How to map the 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dq/T<0$
\end_inset

 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S>0$
\end_inset

 in stat mechanics?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For now, I have to just ensure I don't use classical thermodynamics results
 and proceed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got some answers today.
 Here are the questions that got answered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equivalence of Careotheodeory's statement and Kelvin's statement (partly)
 is essential.
 Then from Careotheodeory's statement, one can show extensivity of entropy.
 This way you know the entropy caused by bringing two systems separately
 at equilibrium into thermal contact.
 So what you learnt is that in thermodynamics, its easier to show Kelvin's
 statement and getting to careotheodeory's to show extensivity of entropy
 takes work.
 In statmech, the extensivity of entropy naturally pops and increase in
 entropy of two systems brought in contact is easier to calculate.
 However, to show that there's an increase in entropy when irreversible
 work is done on a system is not straight forward (atleast not obvious)
 in statmech, which was super simple in thermodynamics.
 So you need to complete the square.
 :)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If we do work on a system with constant force (talking about thermodynamics),
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $dW\leq J.\delta x$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $dW$
\end_inset

 is the work done on the system.
 This is said to happen because there's dissapation.
 The work done is irreversible when the equality doesn't hold.
 But if I don't consider any dissepative forces, then were does the energy
 go? The answer is simply that in that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 will be a funciton time.
 It will keep oscilating and your thermodynamic coordinates won't be well
 defined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The previous problem was motivated by trying to construct the gibbs canonical
 ensamble.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The first part of this is that figuring how 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 are physically different and yet their mathematical formulation almost
 identical.
 The difference lies in the understanding that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta Q_{1}=-\delta Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 while the corresponding term for 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 being 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{1}\neq-\delta W_{2}$
\end_inset

 in general.
 So if we use the (and stupidly enough) first law of thermodynamics, then
 to make the analysis identical to that of the micro canonical ensamble,
 i'll have to come up with a system in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But since we're doing statmech, when we make the system as shown (look at
 your notes, its just a box, with a diathermal wall, with a spring on the
 right side), we just need to write the hamiltonian.
 This is 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}+H_{2}+U_{\text{spring }}$
\end_inset

.
 So this does it in principle! Your analysis is the same as that of the
 canonical ensamble, with 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}^{\text{Old}}=H_{2}+U_{\text{spring }}$
\end_inset

.
 The paradox comes if you think of the first law and expect 
\begin_inset Formula $E=\text{const }$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $dE\neq0$
\end_inset

 if you write 
\begin_inset Formula $dE=dQ+dW=dW\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The problem is that in thermodynamics, for the internal energy, we never
 considered 'potential energy' thus its change is not included.
 So yes.
 That's that.
 [this seems like non-sense now.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $dW$
\end_inset

 so it must include work done by both the spring and (on) the system.
 Just that the work doesn't cancel because there's friction.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, the system corresponding to the energy 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is simply the same as gibbs, except that the diathermal wall is now adiabatic.
\end_layout

I'm gettting a new class of doubts

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How are we modelling friction in our Hamiltonian? It seems to not matter
 at all!
