\begin_layout Abstract
In my course of study so far, I've realized that there're atleast two good
 ways of studying new material.
 The first is to read the content as a hint (pretend like you're in the
 past and its coming from the future) to yourself for developing a new subject
 from scratch.
 Your mind won't question everything and automatically try to get the point.
 The other is to understand every single word of the material so you've
 mastered it when you're through.
 The first chapter and second (last) chapter reflect the corresponding strategie
s.

\begin_layout Standard
If you've read Griffiths with any love, you would know that Earnshaw's thoerem
 prohibits creation of a minima using electrostatic potential.
 (now don't ask which Griffiths) Thus you can't trap ions conventionally.

\end_inset

The idea is simple.
 Since you can't create a potential minima anywhere inside the boundary,
 you can't trap an ion.
 But you see the saddle point.
 You change the potential rapidly so that the `U' minima oscillates between
 being along the X and Y axis (say).
 This way, on an average, the saddle point sees zero average potential.
 If the ion were anywhere other than this point, it'll experiences oscillating
 forces.
 This effectively results in confinement of the atom.
 Q1.
 How does an oscillating force ensure confinement? Q2.
 What frequencies are most effective and why? Q3.
 How do you know only 1 ion is trapped? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The next immediate question is what restricts the ion in the Z axis.
 Well, we just pin the ion using a positive potential (by putting two electrodes
 along the said axis.)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Controlling the trapped ions
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's say that it is obvious we need the kinetic energy of the ions to be
 much smaller than that it picks up upon interaction with a laser (or upon
 emitting a single photon).
 This number turns up to be about 32 K Hertz (Energy/Plank's constant).
 The corresponding temperature to have thermal energy lower than this, turns
 out to be a few micro kelvins!
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is a serious challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How do you circumvent this? Laser cooling.
 Oximoron you might say but the following little thought is illuminating.
 If you hit an atom with light with opposite momentum, the atom slows down
 as the light is bounced back.
 So if you could get the ions to absorb light preferentially going opposite
 in direction to their momentum, you've found a groundbreaking method of
 cooling!
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

And yes, somebody thought of that too.
 You use something you're already familiar with, resonance and doppler.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Resonance: This is the (in)famous phenomenon where an innocent and mild
 vibration can cause an otherwise stable system to have almost devastating
 effects, given the frequency is just right.
 A similar effect is observed with atoms and with remarkable sensitivity
 to the precision of the frequency.
 Light is absorbed by the atom only when the frequency is just right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Doppler: This is as you're well aware, the principle behind the sound effect
 you get when a car zooms past.
 We exploit this and set the frequency of the laser just below the resonant
 frequency.
 This does it then.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

NOTE: This is not at all this simple.
 Q1.
 If the photon is absorbed, it must be emitted giving the atom a push again!
 Whats wrong? Q2.
 What about line broadening etc.?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Lets get Quantum Computing!
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Ions as Qbits: Every ion is one qubit.
 (In these experiments, we deal with 3-4 Qbits.) To process information on
 these qubits, we need to be able to 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Initialize each qubit individually: This is done by shining light on it
 since they're physically separated enough and as the laser light can be
 focussed to distances much smaller than that between adjacent ions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform C-NOT between any pair of Qubits (either can be the control/target)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Ions as tiny magnets: The ion can be thought of as a tiny magnet.
 We can code point up to be state zero and pointing down to be state one.
 So far it is the same as classical information storage.
 However, quantum mechanically, the magnet can `point in other directions'.
 This is perhaps best understood as some sort of angle the magnet is at
 with the z-axis (the direction of an external magnetic field).
 However this is not a conventional angle.
 When you make a measurement, you'll get state zero or one with probabilities
 proportional to the projection along the relavent axis.
 (Its very handwaving but gets the idea across.
 Do not extend this picture too much without proper formalism) This is then
 as though the atom is in a superposition of zero and one states and you
 get one of them upon measurement.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is exploited for information processing.
 How we probe the ion (qubit) is by using light.
 Its interaction with the ion can be understood as
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Classically; it changes the orientation of magnet as light has (is?) electromagn
etic fields.
 The magnet has again, a frequency dependent response and the twist magnitude
 can be controlled by the duration of the pulse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Quantum(ly?); the laser mixes the zero and one states.
 The frequency and duration can be used to calculated precisely the mix
 created, enabling us to create the desired superpositions.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The computer; ion string: Lets quickly review what C-NOT does.
 You flip the target iff the control is one.
 So, in our setup, the problem is to flip the state of ion B, iff ion A
 is in (say) state one (magnet pointing down).
 Note that we can't quite use the magnetic field of the ions themselves
 for, one they're too small and two, ion A and B may not be adjacent.
 Seems like a deal breaker.
 But these people (the real scientists) are clever.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It goes something like this
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A laser light is shone on ion A such that its absorbed only in state one.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
An ion with magnet down (state one), resonates at a slightly different compared
 to one with magnet up.
 Thus it is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The ion is given a little more energy (higher frequency).
 Why, well cause the ions are able to rattle to and fro their position in
 the trap.
 However this is in a plane perpendicular to the line of ions (the string).
 A vibration in this plane is transmitted to all the ions, because of their
 charge, viz.
 interaction by coulombic forces.
 Now as we are dealing with single ions, it so happens that this whole string
 vibration is also quantized! Thus we give this exact energy extra in the
 laser beam.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
With the entire string vibrating, conditioned by if ion A is in state one,
 we shine a light on ion B with a little less energy.
 If the string is already vibrating, this would be sufficient to interact
 with B.
 This causes ion B to flip its state iff ion A is in state one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, a beam of light is shone on ion A again to kill the vibration of
 the string.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
And that's how its done! Ladies and Gentlemen, we have the ion trap quantum
 computer architecture.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Ofcourse, we've made far too many assumptions but the rough idea should
 be clear now.
 In the following (last) chapter, we address some of the remarks/questions
 you might have (such as what the hell, how do you do that etc.)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The states we make
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First things first.
 What are the states we're looking at and how long will excited states last.
 Lets answer them.
 There are two kinds of states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first are internal energy eigenstates of the ion.
 (refer to the figure)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We write these states as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1},M_{1}},\,\ket{F_{2},M_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{aux},M_{aux}}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{aux}$
\end_inset

 as shown.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The other are the excitations of the centre of mass motion.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The eigenkets of the vibrational motion are written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\{n_{i}\}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the excitations of the various modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Only the ground state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0,0,0\dots}$
\end_inset

 and the first excited state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,0,0\dots}$
\end_inset

 are invoked for the operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This state is loosely called the phonon (used here as the bus bit)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So the states we'll be finally working with, will be the following tensor
 products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\ket{0,0}\equiv\ket{F_{1},M_{1}}\otimes\ket{0,0,0\dots}\\
\ket{0,1}\equiv\ket{F_{1},M_{1}}\otimes\ket{1,0,0\dots}\\
\ket{1,0}\equiv\ket{F_{2},M_{2}}\otimes\ket{0,0,0\dots}\\
\ket{0,1}\equiv\ket{F_{2},M_{2}}\otimes\ket{1,0,0\dots}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That answers the first question.
 The second is answered by the well known (but not well understood for me
 so far) energy time uncertainty relation, which unlike the unambiguous
 position momentum uncertainty arising from the commutation relation, refers
 to a more general class of such uncertainty relations (including ones that
 arise from perturbation theory).
 The point is that since all the levels considered here are low-lying, separated
 oh so mildly (hyperfine and Zeeman interactions), that the lifetime of
 the excited states (against spontaneous emission) is essentially infinite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The gates it takes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We show how to perform the following operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

in the computational basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}$
\end_inset

.
 So in essence, if the internal state is zero, then you do nothing.
 Else you apply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 to the phonon.

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that these three operations together can be used to carry out
 arbitrary transformations to the qubits stored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
CROT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember there were these 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{aux},M_{aux}}$
\end_inset

 eigenstates of the ion which we didn't use in the definition of the computation
al basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0,1},\ket{0,1}$
\end_inset

 etc.
 We now define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ket{aux,i}=\ket{F_{aux},M_{aux}}\otimes\ket{i,0,0,0\dots}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

.
 These states are available to us as kind of shelves.
 These help us make state-dependent transformations (such as controlled
 rotations).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A look at the figure shows that if a radiation of frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{aux}+\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 is applied, then only transitions between 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{aux,0}$
\end_inset

 will occur (assuming states in unwanted levels are unoccupied).

\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 radians.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is precisely what was required.
 If the state is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,1}$
\end_inset

 its sign is flipped.
 (Note: Don't confuse the state of the computational basis with that of
 the auxilary state, which is in a zero phonon state)

Claim: A

\begin_layout Standard
Justification: This should be obvious from the previous discussion and the

Arbitrary Internal State Rotations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rotate an ion's internal state without affecting the phonon (centre of

Claim: If such a radiation has a phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 wrt some defined origin of phase, and duration sufficient to make a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\pi$

 pulse, then the effect in the computational basis is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V^{p}(\phi)\equiv\left[\begin{array}{cc}
cos(p\pi/2) & -e^{-i\phi}sin(p\pi/2)\\
-e^{i\phi}cos(p\pi/2) & cos(p\pi/2)
\end{array}\right]\otimes\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\emph default
To apply such rotations successfully, it is required that experimentally,
 the phase is controlled at the position of the ion (and not just some other
 physical location, like a stable reference cavity).
 In this regard therefore it is much easier if the computational basis of
 the system are separated by radio frequencies and not optical frequencies.

Claim 2: In order to have the right phase experimentally, one needn't worry

Claim 3: However problems arise when different ions have different frequencies

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Universalization: CNOT detour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already developed enough machinery to implement an XOR (a reversible
 XOR is the same as a CNOT) between the bus (phonon) and some particular
 ion.
 To recall, C NOT is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{XOR}\equiv\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1\\
 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

The matrix is wrong isn't it? No! We are doing a CNOT(bus,ion) as opposed
 to CNOT(ion,bus).
 Here's the sequence that does the trick
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi/2$
\end_inset

 pulse with frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V^{1/2}(-\pi/2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
-1 & 1
\end{array}\right]_{\text{ion}}\otimes\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\

\begin_inset Formula $V^{1/2}(\pi/2)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q1.
 How did they come up with this? Whats the rationale behind this?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be checked that the result is infact XOR(bus,ion) as given by the
 matrix above.
 So by symmetry XOR(ion,bus) should be a similar sequence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 replaced with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 to cause the vibration (bus) level to get affected independent of the ion.
 Right? Nope.
 Let's understand this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic issue is that vibrations (the bus) aren't a two level system.
 And where does this bite us? Well, recall how in the implementation of
 the CROT we assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{aux,1}$
\end_inset

 is unoccupied, for if it were, then upon flashing 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{aux}+\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 it would merrily couple to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,2}$
\end_inset

 which is, surprise surprise, outside our computation Hilber space!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SWAP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well this is by far the easiest to implement.
 Just consider the frequncy 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}-\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 and look at the transitions diagram.
 The only possible transition is between 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{01}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{10}$
\end_inset

 (assuming ofcourse there's no population in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{11},\,\ket{02}$
\end_inset

 states etc.).
 So then that does it! We have swapped successfully between the bus and
 any one of the ions.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that completes the gates part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to see without mistakes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To complete the operation of the processor, we must be able to make measurements.
 This is achieved with high accuracy, using what is known as `electron shelving'
 or `quantum jumps' technique.
 This results in whether the ion is in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1}M_{1}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{2}M_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is achieved by illuminating the ion with a radiation resonant with
 a transition from 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1}M_{1}}$
\end_inset

 to some high-lying level, whose line-width is sufficiently small so that
 transitions from 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{2}M_{2}}$
\end_inset

 aren't excited (else what's the point eigh?).
 Now if the flourescence is produced, the ion state has collapsed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1}M_{1}}$
\end_inset

; if its not produced, then you know it is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{2}M_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that you can't readout the bus directly, but since you can swap, it's
 not an issue now is it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you realize what you've done? If this doesn't blow your mind, then you
 have no feelings!
