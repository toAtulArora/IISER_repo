\begin_layout Abstract
In my course of study so far, I've realized that there're atleast two good
 ways of studying new material.
 The first is to read the content as a hint (pretend like you're in the
 past and its coming from the future) to yourself for developing a new subject
 from scratch.
 Your mind won't question everything and automatically try to get the point.
 The other is to understand every single word of the material so you've
 mastered it when you're through.
 The first chapter and second (last) chapter reflect the corresponding strategie
s.

\begin_layout Standard
If you've read Griffiths with any love, you would know that Earnshaw's thoerem
 prohibits creation of a minima using electrostatic potential.
 (now don't ask which Griffiths) Thus you can't trap ions conventionally.

\end_inset

The idea is simple.
 Since you can't create a potential minima anywhere inside the boundary,
 you can't trap an ion.
 But you see the saddle point.
 You change the potential rapidly so that the `U' minima oscillates between
 being along the X and Y axis (say).
 This way, on an average, the saddle point sees zero average potential.
 If the ion were anywhere other than this point, it'll experiences oscillating
 forces.
 This effectively results in confinement of the atom.
 Q1.
 How does an oscillating force ensure confinement? Q2.
 What frequencies are most effective and why? Q3.
 How do you know only 1 ion is trapped? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The next immediate question is what restricts the ion in the Z axis.
 Well, we just pin the ion using a positive potential (by putting two electrodes
 along the said axis.)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Controlling the trapped ions
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's say that it is obvious we need the kinetic energy of the ions to be
 much smaller than that it picks up upon interaction with a laser (or upon
 emitting a single photon).
 This number turns up to be about 32 K Hertz (Energy/Plank's constant).
 The corresponding temperature to have thermal energy lower than this, turns
 out to be a few micro kelvins!
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is a serious challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How do you circumvent this? Laser cooling.
 Oximoron you might say but the following little thought is illuminating.
 If you hit an atom with light with opposite momentum, the atom slows down
 as the light is bounced back.
 So if you could get the ions to absorb light preferentially going opposite
 in direction to their momentum, you've found a groundbreaking method of
 cooling!
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

And yes, somebody thought of that too.
 You use something you're already familiar with, resonance and doppler.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Resonance: This is the (in)famous phenomenon where an innocent and mild
 vibration can cause an otherwise stable system to have almost devastating
 effects, given the frequency is just right.
 A similar effect is observed with atoms and with remarkable sensitivity
 to the precision of the frequency.
 Light is absorbed by the atom only when the frequency is just right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Doppler: This is as you're well aware, the principle behind the sound effect
 you get when a car zooms past.
 We exploit this and set the frequency of the laser just below the resonant
 frequency.
 This does it then.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

NOTE: This is not at all this simple.
 Q1.
 If the photon is absorbed, it must be emitted giving the atom a push again!
 Whats wrong? Q2.
 What about line broadening etc.?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Lets get Quantum Computing!
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Ions as Qbits: Every ion is one qubit.
 (In these experiments, we deal with 3-4 Qbits.) To process information on
 these qubits, we need to be able to 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Initialize each qubit individually: This is done by shining light on it
 since they're physically separated enough and as the laser light can be
 focussed to distances much smaller than that between adjacent ions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform C-NOT between any pair of Qubits (either can be the control/target)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Ions as tiny magnets: The ion can be thought of as a tiny magnet.
 We can code point up to be state zero and pointing down to be state one.
 So far it is the same as classical information storage.
 However, quantum mechanically, the magnet can `point in other directions'.
 This is perhaps best understood as some sort of angle the magnet is at
 with the z-axis (the direction of an external magnetic field).
 However this is not a conventional angle.
 When you make a measurement, you'll get state zero or one with probabilities
 proportional to the projection along the relavent axis.
 (Its very handwaving but gets the idea across.
 Do not extend this picture too much without proper formalism) This is then
 as though the atom is in a superposition of zero and one states and you
 get one of them upon measurement.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is exploited for information processing.
 How we probe the ion (qubit) is by using light.
 Its interaction with the ion can be understood as
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Classically; it changes the orientation of magnet as light has (is?) electromagn
etic fields.
 The magnet has again, a frequency dependent response and the twist magnitude
 can be controlled by the duration of the pulse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Quantum(ly?); the laser mixes the zero and one states.
 The frequency and duration can be used to calculated precisely the mix
 created, enabling us to create the desired superpositions.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The computer; ion string: Lets quickly review what C-NOT does.
 You flip the target iff the control is one.
 So, in our setup, the problem is to flip the state of ion B, iff ion A
 is in (say) state one (magnet pointing down).
 Note that we can't quite use the magnetic field of the ions themselves
 for, one they're too small and two, ion A and B may not be adjacent.
 Seems like a deal breaker.
 But these people (the real scientists) are clever.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It goes something like this
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A laser light is shone on ion A such that its absorbed only in state one.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
An ion with magnet down (state one), resonates at a slightly different compared
 to one with magnet up.
 Thus it is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The ion is given a little more energy (higher frequency).
 Why, well cause the ions are able to rattle to and fro their position in
 the trap.
 However this is in a plane perpendicular to the line of ions (the string).
 A vibration in this plane is transmitted to all the ions, because of their
 charge, viz.
 interaction by coulombic forces.
 Now as we are dealing with single ions, it so happens that this whole string
 vibration is also quantized! Thus we give this exact energy extra in the
 laser beam.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
With the entire string vibrating, conditioned by if ion A is in state one,
 we shine a light on ion B with a little less energy.
 If the string is already vibrating, this would be sufficient to interact
 with B.
 This causes ion B to flip its state iff ion A is in state one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, a beam of light is shone on ion A again to kill the vibration of
 the string.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
And that's how its done! Ladies and Gentlemen, we have the ion trap quantum
 computer architecture.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Ofcourse, we've made far too many assumptions but the rough idea should
 be clear now.
 In the following (last) chapter, we address some of the remarks/questions
 you might have (such as what the hell, how do you do that etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Prologue; the trap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Minimum Requirements (for the computer and the reader)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics
 (Dirac's formulation preferably) and also understands qubits and their
 role in information processing.
 The following is intended to briefly review some concepts that'll be used
 and to comment on some aspects specific to the architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be shown that to produce arbitrary unitary transformations of the
 state of a set of qubits, it is sufficent to be able to produce arbitrary
 rotations in the Hilbert space of any individual qubit and to be able to
 carry out the controlled-rotation operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although conventionally we use C NOTs instead of C ROTs, the latter is more
 important for it is easier to implement physically and thus the changed
 generalization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, a further simplification made can be made as follows.
 Instead of seeking CROT between any pair of qubits directly, it is sufficient
 to have one special qubit which can undergo CROT with any of the other.
 This special qubit is refered to as a 'bus' and can be used to carry informatio
n around using another gate called SWAP (does what it says, swaps the qubits).
 Although this can be decomposed into the aforesaid gates, in practice,
 this can be directly implemented physically.
 The major disadvantage of the bus method is that parallel operations aren't
 possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accepting the limitations and proceeding with the 'bus' idea, we have the
 following minimum requirements of our quantum processor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Arbitrary rotations of any single qubit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
CROT between the bus and any other qubit (note, the other way round is not
 required, viz.
 the control is bit is the bus)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
SWAP between the bus and any other qubit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be shown in the following section how all of these can be achieved
 on the ion trap architecture.
 Other than this ofcourse, we must be able to make measurements also.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, it is worthwhile to remark that a processor with a few qubits may
 be built using a single particle with sufficient degrees of freedom.
 The ion trap approach however is more sensible in realizing an interesting
 enough quantum computer, with say a hundred qubits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Setup, the trap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We discuss here an ion trap with a line of N trapped ions.
 Each ion has two stable and two metastable states (such as hyperfine or
 two zeeman levels).
 There's a setup to point laser beams to interact with any of the N ions.
 Each ion constitutes one qubit; the two internal energy eigenkets of the
 ion.
 There's also the bus qubit discussed in the previous section.
 The vibrational motion of the whole string of ions constitutes this qubit.
 This motion must be quantized for it to be usable as a qubit.
 This thus requires cooling the ion string well below the `quantum limit',
 defined with respect to the axial vibrational frequency,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{B}T\ll\hbar\omega_{z}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This happens to be one of the most challenging parts of the experimental
 setup, after making the trap and catching the ions.
 (Subtleties related to the ``Lambe-Dicke'' regime haven't been discussed)
 Further, in brief, there're two known traps, the Paul (rf) and the Penning
 (Magnetic) and it so turns out that the former allows for tighter confinement
 (useful for cooling) and allows for magnetic fields to be used for other
 useful purposes such as splitting into zeeman levels.
 Further, tighter trapping leads to faster `switching time' for quantum
 gates such as CROT to be discussed in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modeling the motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The N trapped ions are modelled as a system of N point charges in a harmonic
 potential well of tight radial confinement, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{x},\omega_{y}\gg\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Obviously, the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\omega_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 will be determined by the electrode geometry and potentials, which will
 not be discussed in this report.
 The corresponding hamiltonian is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{2}M\left(\omega_{x}^{2}X_{i}^{2}+\omega_{x}^{2}Y_{i}^{2}+\omega_{x}^{2}Z_{i}^{2}+\frac{\mathbf{P}_{i}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j>i}\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
\]

\end_inset

 where the position and momentum are operators.
 Assertion: at low temperatures, for tight radial confinement, the ions
 all lie along the z-axis.
 Consequently it is reasonable to assume 
\begin_inset Formula $|R_{i}-R_{j}|\approx|Z_{i}-Z_{j}|$
\end_inset

 which allows for the radial and axial motion to be separated.
 Considering the axial motion, we first find a relevant length scale, say
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z_{s}=\left(\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}M\omega_{z}^{2}}\right)^{1/3}\approx10-100\,\mu m
\]

\end_inset

which is of the order of separation between the ions.
 Solving the equation classically, one obtains the equilibrium positions
 of the ions.
 As is expected, for larger N, the outer ions tend to push the inner ions
 closer.
 Consequently, the spacing between the ions depends upon N.
 However, it is not so obvious that the two normal modes of oscillation
 about these equilibrium positions are independent of N (for small oscillations
 that is).
 Besides, even higher harmonics are nearly independent of N.
 The frequencies of the two normal modes are 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 (the list goes 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,\sqrt{3},\,\sqrt{29/5},\,3.051,\,3.671,\,4.272,\,4.865\dots\}$
\end_inset

 times 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

).
 In the lowest of mode of oscillation all the ions move to and fro together.
 This mode thus corresponds to the harmonic motion of the centre of mass
 of the ion string.
 Since the frequencies of the higher harmonics are so different from that
 of the ground normal mode, it can be excited selectively, without exciting
 the other modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far everything was classical.
 In cranking things up to the quantum level, we simply treat the centre
 of mass coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{cm}$
\end_inset

 as a harmonic oscillator.
 We assert that the classically determined ground state excitation frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 continues to be valid even though the ion wave functions now overlap; they
 delicately cancel upon calculation of the centre of mass motion.
 Accepting this assertion, we proceed by noting that the harmonic oscillator
 has 
\begin_inset Formula $NM$
\end_inset

 mass and frequncy 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the energy eigenfunctions are given as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{n}(z_{cm})=\left(\frac{NM\omega_{z}}{\pi\hbar2^{2n}(n!)^{2}}\right)^{1/4}H_{n}\left(z_{cm}\sqrt{NM\omega_{z}/\hbar}\right)e^{-NM\omega_{z}z_{cm}^{2}/2\hbar}
\]

\end_inset

This gives us the extent of spatial spread of the ground state probability
 distribution, which is given by its standard deviation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta z_{cm}=\sqrt{\hbar/2NM\omega_{z}}
\]

\end_inset

We certainly don't want our inter-ion distance to be comparable to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z_{cm}$
\end_inset

, else addressing each ion individually with a laser beam would become unnecessa
rily hard, if not impossible.
 Thus we require 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z_{cm}\ll\Delta z_{min}$
\end_inset

.
 A numerical solution yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta z_{min}\approx2.0z_{s}N^{-0.57}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the length we found in the beginning (this formula remains valid till
 
\begin_inset Formula $N\approx1000$
\end_inset

).
 Imposing the inequality we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\omega_{z}}{M}\ll\frac{31N^{1.86}}{\hbar^{3}}\left(\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\right)^{2}\approx2.4\times10^{21}N^{1.86}\,\text{Hz/u}
\]

\end_inset

where u is the atomic mass unit (
\begin_inset Formula $1.66057\times10^{-27}$
\end_inset

 kg).
 The parameters here are the frequency which we said depends on the geometry
 and potentials of the electrodes.
 The mass of the atom is also somewhat in our control (depends on which
 we choose, but there're other factors influencing that also).
 However, in practice, this condition is found to be easily satisfied.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 is no more than a GHz, while 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 ranges from 9 to 200 u.
 It's thus accurate to image the ions as sitting on a line, with their small
 wavepacket centred at their classical equilibrium location, with essentially
 no overlap with others.
 It must be stated that this condition alone doesn't guarantee that the
 separation is enough to allow unique addressing of the ions by laser beams.

\begin_layout Section
Matrix: From paper to our loyal ions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The states we make
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First things first.
 What are the states we're looking at and how long will excited states last.
 Lets answer them.
 There are two kinds of states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first are internal energy eigenstates of the ion.
 (refer to the figure)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We write these states as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1},M_{1}},\,\ket{F_{2},M_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{aux},M_{aux}}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{aux}$
\end_inset

 as shown.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The other are the excitations of the centre of mass motion.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The eigenkets of the vibrational motion are written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\{n_{i}\}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the excitations of the various modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Only the ground state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0,0,0\dots}$
\end_inset

 and the first excited state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,0,0\dots}$
\end_inset

 are invoked for the operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This state is loosely called the phonon (used here as the bus bit)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So the states we'll be finally working with, will be the following tensor
 products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\ket{0,0}\equiv\ket{F_{1},M_{1}}\otimes\ket{0,0,0\dots}\\
\ket{0,1}\equiv\ket{F_{1},M_{1}}\otimes\ket{1,0,0\dots}\\
\ket{1,0}\equiv\ket{F_{2},M_{2}}\otimes\ket{0,0,0\dots}\\
\ket{0,1}\equiv\ket{F_{2},M_{2}}\otimes\ket{1,0,0\dots}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That answers the first question.
 The second is answered by the well known (but not well understood for me
 so far) energy time uncertainty relation, which unlike the unambiguous
 position momentum uncertainty arising from the commutation relation, refers
 to a more general class of such uncertainty relations (including ones that
 arise from perturbation theory).
 The point is that since all the levels considered here are low-lying, separated
 oh so mildly (hyperfine and Zeeman interactions), that the lifetime of
 the excited states (against spontaneous emission) is essentially infinite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The gates it takes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We show how to perform the following operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
CROT
\emph default
 between any ion's internal state and the phonon bit, where CROT is given
 by
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Formula

1\\

\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

in the computational basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}$
\end_inset

.
 So in essence, if the internal state is zero, then you do nothing.
 Else you apply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 to the phonon.
\end_layout

\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that these three operations together can be used to carry out
 arbitrary transformations to the qubits stored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
CROT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember there were these 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{aux},M_{aux}}$
\end_inset

 eigenstates of the ion which we didn't use in the definition of the computation
al basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0,1},\ket{0,1}$
\end_inset

 etc.
 We now define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ket{aux,i}=\ket{F_{aux},M_{aux}}\otimes\ket{i,0,0,0\dots}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

.
 These states are available to us as kind of shelves.
 These help us make state-dependent transformations (such as controlled
 rotations).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A look at the figure shows that if a radiation of frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{aux}+\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 is applied, then only transitions between 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,1}$

Justification: This should be obvious from the previous discussion and the
 diagram.
 Effectively then, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\text{C\rightharpoondown ROT}}$
\end_inset

 rotates the second qubit if the first is in state zero rather than one.

Arbitrary Internal State Rotations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rotate an ion's internal state without affecting the phonon (centre of
 mass motion), a pulse of frequency, without surprise, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 is applied.

Claim: If such a radiation has a phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 wrt some defined origin of phase, and duration sufficient to make a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\pi$
\end_inset

 pulse, then the effect in the computational basis is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V^{p}(\phi)\equiv\left[\begin{array}{cc}
cos(p\pi/2) & -e^{-i\phi}sin(p\pi/2)\\
-e^{i\phi}cos(p\pi/2) & cos(p\pi/2)
\end{array}\right]\otimes\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\emph default
To apply such rotations successfully, it is required that experimentally,
 the phase is controlled at the position of the ion (and not just some other
 physical location, like a stable reference cavity).
 In this regard therefore it is much easier if the computational basis of
 the system are separated by radio frequencies and not optical frequencies.

Claim 2: In order to have the right phase experimentally, one needn't worry
 about the continuous precession with

Claim 3: However problems arise when different ions have different frequencies
 due to the residual electric and magnetic fields in the apparatus, although
 such problems are solvable.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Universalization: CNOT detour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already developed enough machinery to implement an XOR (a reversible
 XOR is the same as a CNOT) between the bus (phonon) and some particular
 ion.
 To recall, C NOT is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{XOR}\equiv\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1\\
 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

The matrix is wrong isn't it? No! We are doing a CNOT(bus,ion) as opposed
 to CNOT(ion,bus).
 Here's the sequence that does the trick

1 & 1\\
-1 & 1
\end{array}\right]_{\text{ion}}\otimes\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\

Q1.
 How did they come up with this? Whats the rationale behind this?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be checked that the result is infact XOR(bus,ion) as given by the
 matrix above.
 So by symmetry XOR(ion,bus) should be a similar sequence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 replaced with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 to cause the vibration (bus) level to get affected independent of the ion.
 Right? Nope.
 Let's understand this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic issue is that vibrations (the bus) aren't a two level system.
 And where does this bite us? Well, recall how in the implementation of
 the CROT we assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{aux,1}$
\end_inset

 is unoccupied, for if it were, then upon flashing 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{aux}+\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 it would merrily couple to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1,2}$
\end_inset

 which is, surprise surprise, outside our computation Hilber space!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SWAP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well this is by far the easiest to implement.
 Just consider the frequncy 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}-\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

 and look at the transitions diagram.
 The only possible transition is between 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{01}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{10}$
\end_inset

 (assuming ofcourse there's no population in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{11},\,\ket{02}$
\end_inset

 states etc.).
 So then that does it! We have swapped successfully between the bus and
 any one of the ions.

And that completes the gates part.

\begin_layout Subsection
How to see without mistakes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To complete the operation of the processor, we must be able to make measurements.
 This is achieved with high accuracy, using what is known as `electron shelving'
 or `quantum jumps' technique.
 This results in whether the ion is in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1}M_{1}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{2}M_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is achieved by illuminating the ion with a radiation resonant with
 a transition from 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1}M_{1}}$
\end_inset

 to some high-lying level, whose line-width is sufficiently small so that
 transitions from 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{2}M_{2}}$
\end_inset

 aren't excited (else what's the point eigh?).
 Now if the flourescence is produced, the ion state has collapsed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{1}M_{1}}$
\end_inset

; if its not produced, then you know it is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{F_{2}M_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that you can't readout the bus directly, but since you can swap, it's
 not an issue now is it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in effect, do you realize what you've done? If this doesn't blow your
 mind, then you have no feelings!
